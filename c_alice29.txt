up

somehow

sea,

to

However, 
/18 
/256 
/37 
/59 
/69 
/18 
/7 
in

pool 
of 
tears

wept

nine

`I

I

/387 
as

swam 
about,

to

/11 
/60 
out. 
`I

be 
punished

it 
now, 
I 
suppose,

That

everything

queer 
to-day.' 
Just 
/82 
/18 
heard 
something 
splashing 
/115 
in 
/1 
pool 
a 
/249 
/60 
/293 
/0 
/18 
swam 
nearer 
to 
/130 
/59 
/26 
it 
was: 
at 
/351 
/18 
thought 
it 
/186 
be 
a 
walrus 
or 
hippopotamus, 
/23 
/82 
/18 
remembered 
/104 
/372 
/18 
/7 
now, 
/0 
/18 
/256 
/37 
/59 
/69 
it 
/7 
/391 
a 
mouse 
/69 
/19 
slipped 
in 
/108 
herself. 
`Would 
it 
be 
of 
/360 
use, 
now,' 
thought 
/387 
`to 
speak 
to 
/182 
mouse? 
Everything 
is 
so 
out-of-the-way 
/98 
here, 
/69 
I 
/258 
/57 
/9 
/170 
it 
can 
talk: 
at 
/360 
rate, 
there's 
no 
harm 
in 
trying.' 
So 
/18 
began: 
`O 
Mouse, 
do 
/194 
/392 
/1 
/60 
/59 
of 
/182 
pool? 
I 
am 
/9 
/10 
of 
swimming 
/115 
here, 
O 
Mouse!' 
/209 
thought 
/182 
/186 
be 
/1 
/206 
/60 
of 
speaking 
to 
a 
mouse: 
/18 
/19 
/86 
done 
/160 
a 
/490 
before, 
/23 
/18 
remembered 
/14 
/88 
in 
/11 
brother's 
Latin 
Grammar, 
`A 
mouse--of 
a 
mouse--to 
a 
mouse--a 
mouse--O 
mouse!' 
/107 
Mouse 
/81 
at 
/11 
/227 
inquisitively, 
/0 
/75 
to 
/11 
to 
wink 
/46 
/151 
of 
its 
/249 
eyes, 
/23 
it 
/184 
nothing. 
`Perhaps 
it 
doesn't 
understand 
English,' 
thought 
/456 
`I 
daresay 
/323 
a 
French 
/274 
/176 
/68 
/46 
William

Conqueror.' 
(For,

/74

knowledge 
of 
history, 
/6 
/19 
no 
/9 
clear 
notion 
/104 
/314 
ago 
anything 
/19 
happened.) 
So 
/18 
/216 
again: 
`Ou 
est 
ma 
chatte?' 
/290 
/7 
/1 
/351 
sentence 
in 
/11 
French 
lesson-book. 
/107 
Mouse 
/498 
a 
sudden 
leap 
/59 
of 
/1 
water, 
/0 
/75 
to 
quiver 
/74 
/68 
/46 
fright. 
`Oh, 
I 
beg 
/436 
pardon!' 
cried 
/6 
hastily, 
afraid 
/69 
/18 
/19 
hurt 
/1 
/386 
animal's 
feelings. 
`I 
/76 
forgot 
/194 
/231 
/108 
cats.' 
`Not 
/108 
cats!' 
cried 
/1 
Mouse, 
in 
a 
shrill, 
passionate 
voice. 
`Would 
YOU 
/108 
/276 
if 
/194 
/138 
me?' 
`Well, 
perhaps 
not,' 
/184 
/6 
in 
a 
soothing 
tone: 
`don't 
be 
angry 
/115 
/158 
/279 
yet 
I 
/265 
I 
/245

/6 
/103 
/83 
/398 
to 
herself, 
as 
/18 
swam 
lazily 
/115 
in 
/1 
pool, 
/25 
/18 
sits 
purring 
so 
nicely 
by

fire, 
licking

washing

/18 
is 
/160 
a

she's 
/160 
a 
capital 
/151 
/34

mice--oh, 
I 
beg 
/436 
pardon!' 
cried 
/6 
again, 
/34 
/182 
/73 
/1 
Mouse 
/7 
bristling 
/74 
over, 
/0 
/18 
/291 
certain 
it 
/186 
be 
/396 
offended. 
`We 
won't 
talk 
/115 
/11 
/360 
/479 
if 
you'd 
/227 
not.' 
`We 
indeed!' 
cried 
/1 
Mouse, 
/419 
/7 
trembling 
/98 
to 
/1 
end 
of 
his 
tail. 
`As 
if 
I 
/41 
talk 
on

Our

always 
HATED

low, 
vulgar 
things! 
Don't

me

/237 
again!' 
`I 
won't 
indeed!' 
/184 
/387 
in 
a 
/152 
hurry 
to 
change

subject 
of 
conversation. 
`Are 
you--are 
/194 
fond--of--of 
dogs?' 
/107 
Mouse 
/56 
/114 
answer, 
so 
/6 
/103 
on 
eagerly: 
`There 
is 
/160 
a 
/212 
/249 
dog 
/187

house 
I 
/258 
/108 
to 
show 
you! 
A

know, 
/46 
oh,

/314 
curly 
brown 
hair! 
/279 
/219 
fetch 
/197 
/43 
/194 
throw 
them, 
/0 
/219 
sit 
up

beg 
/34 
its 
dinner,

/74

can't 
remember

of 
them--and 
it 
belongs 
to

he 
says 
/323 
so 
useful, 
/323 
/42 
a

He 
says 
it 
kills 
/74

rats 
and--oh 
dear!' 
cried 
/6 
in 
a 
sorrowful 
tone, 
`I'm 
afraid

offended 
it 
again!' 
For 
/1 
Mouse 
/7 
swimming

/150 
/11 
as

as

go, 
/0 
/40 
/76 
a 
commotion 
in

went. 
So 
/18 
called 
softly

`Mouse

When

Dodo,

/60 
to

/59 
a

(`the

it

it

easy 
to

/308 
However,

running

an 
hour 
or 
so, 
/0 
/138 
/76 
/307 
again,

Dodo 
suddenly 
called

`The

over!' 
/0 
/137 
/74 
crowded 
/335 
/24 
panting,

asking, 
`But

This 
question

Dodo 
/245 
/114 
/288 
without 
a

deal 
of

it 
/491 
/34 
a

/73 
/46 
/151 
/437 
pressed

its

(the

Shakespeare,

At

`EVERYBODY

`But 
/419 
is 
to 
give 
/1 
prizes?' 
/76 
a 
chorus 
of 
voices 
asked. 
`Why, 
SHE, 
of 
course,' 
/184 
/1 
Dodo, 
pointing 
to 
/6 
/46 
/151 
finger;

whole

at

/111 
`Prizes!

to

in 
despair 
/18 
/156 
/11 
/296 
in

pulled 
/59 
a 
box 
of 
comfits, 
(luckily

salt 
water 
/19 
/114 
/207 
/21 
it), 
/0 
handed 
/236 
/335 
as 
prizes. 
/52 
/7 
exactly 
/151 
a-piece 
/74 
round. 
`But 
/18 
/186 
/71 
a 
prize 
herself, 
/194 
/468 
/184 
/1 
Mouse. 
`Of

/1 
Dodo 
replied 
/9 
gravely.

/254 
/71 
/194 
/207 
in

he 
/103 
/83 
turning 
to 
Alice. 
`Only 
a 
thimble,' 
/184 
/6 
sadly. 
`Hand 
it 
/68 
here,' 
/184 
/1 
Dodo. 
Then 
/137 
/74 
crowded 
/335 
/11 
/16 
more, 
while 
/1 
Dodo 
solemnly 
presented 
/1 
thimble, 
/280 
`We 
beg 
/436 
acceptance 
of

thimble'; 
and, 
/43 
it 
/19 
finished 
/182 
short 
speech, 
/137 
/74 
cheered. 
/6 
thought 
/1 
whole 
/490 
/9 
absurd,

/137 
/74 
/81 
so 
grave 
/69 
/18 
/56 
/114 
dare 
to 
laugh; 
and, 
as 
/18 
/245 
/114 
/57 
of 
anything 
to 
/319 
/18 
simply 
bowed, 
/0 
/148 
/1 
thimble, 
looking 
as 
solemn 
as 
/18 
could. 
/107 
next 
/490 
/7 
to 
/277 
/1 
comfits: 
/182 
caused 
/110 
noise 
/0 
confusion, 
as

/99 
birds 
complained 
/69 
/137 
/245 
/114 
/447 
theirs, 
/0 
/1 
/372 
ones 
choked 
/0 
/19 
to 
be 
patted 
on

back. 
However, 
it 
/7 
/68 
at 
last, 
/0 
/137 
/491 
/98 
again 
in 
a 
ring, 
/0 
begged 
/1 
Mouse 
to 
/299 
/236 
something 
more. 
`You

me

/184 
/387 
/25 
why

/18 
added 
in 
a 
whisper, 
/398 
afraid

it 
/41 
be 
offended 
/106 
`Mine 
is 
a

a

/184 
/1 
Mouse, 
turning 
to

/0 
sighing. 
`It 
IS 
a

tail, 
certainly,' 
/184 
/387 
looking 
/98 
/46 
/124 
at 
/1 
Mouse's 
tail; 
`but 
why 
do 
/194 
call 
it 
sad?' 
/279 
/18 
kept 
on 
puzzling 
/115 
it 
while 
/1 
Mouse 
/7 
speaking, 
so 
/69 
/11 
/210 
of 
/1 
tale 
/7 
something 
/108 
this:-- 
`Fury 
/184 
to 
a

he 
met 
in

house, 
"Let 
us

Said

to

"Such

`I

humbly: 
`you

`I 
/19 
NOT!' 
cried

Mouse, 
sharply

angrily. 
`A

always 
ready

looking

`Please

impatiently,

Lory, 
as

as 
it

`Hold

/184 
/1

a

`You're

aloud,

at

wrapping 
itself 
up

carefully, 
remarking,

I 
hadn't 
mentioned 
Dinah!' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself 
in 
a 
melancholy 
tone. 
`Nobody

lonely

low-spirited. 
In 
a

again 
heard 
a

pattering 
of

/81 
up 
eagerly,

looking 
anxiously

as

as 
if

lost 
something;

/18 
heard 
it 
muttering 
to 
itself 
`The

Duchess! 
Oh

hunting

/138 
nowhere

completely. 
Very

/45 
noticed

as

/103 
hunting 
about, 
/0 
called

to

in 
an 
angry 
tone, 
`Why, 
Mary

ARE

so

frightened

/49 
/167 
at

direction 
it 
pointed

without

`He

`How

As

to

uncorked 
it

`I

SOMETHING

/184 
to 
herself, 
`whenever

It 
/56 
so 
indeed,

/385

/147 
hastily 
/156 
/98 
/1 
bottle, 
/280 
to 
herself 
`That's

enough--I

Alas! 
it

/147 
/103 
on 
growing,

growing,

/9 
/256 
/19 
to 
kneel

on

Still

on

and, 
as 
a 
last 
resource,

/151

to

`Now

Luckily 
/34

magic

/457 
/19 
its

/18 
grew 
no

it

uncomfortable,

no

getting

no

/18 
/291 
unhappy. 
`It 
/7 
/58 
pleasanter 
at 
home,' 
thought 
/386 
/387 
`when 
/151 
wasn't

rabbits. 
I

I

yet--and

I 
used 
to

fairy-tales,

/279 
/43 
I 
grow

/414 
write 
one--but 
/270 
grown 
up 
now,' 
/18 
added 
in 
a 
sorrowful 
tone; 
`at

there's 
no 
room 
to 
grow 
up 
/360 
/479 
HERE.' 
`But 
then,' 
thought 
/387 
`shall 
I 
/175 
/8 
/360 
older 
/374 
I 
am 
now? 
That'll 
be 
a 
comfort,

way--never

-but 
then--always

THAT!' 
`Oh, 
/194 
foolish 
Alice!' 
/18 
answered 
herself. 
`How 
can

/165 
there's

/34

/279 
so

/103 
/83 
taking

/151 
/337 
/0 
/82 
/1

a

altogether; 
/23 
/94 
a

minutes 
/18 
heard 
a

outside,

stopped 
to

`Mary 
Ann! 
Mary 
Ann!' 
/184 
/1 
voice. 
`Fetch 
me 
my

/182 
moment!' 
Then 
/304 
a 
/249 
pattering 
of 
/312 
on

stairs. 
/6 
knew 
it

/115 
a

as

as

/19 
no

/1 
/45 
/304 
up 
to

it;

inwards, 
/0 
Alice's 
elbow 
/7 
pressed 
hard 
against

/69 
attempt 
proved 
a 
failure. 
/6 
heard 
it 
/62 
to 
itself 
`Then 
/414 
go 
/335 
/0 
/8 
in 
at 
/1 
window.' 
`THAT 
/194 
won't' 
thought 
/387 
and, 
/94 
waiting 
till 
/18 
fancied 
/18 
heard 
/1 
/45 
/95 
/100 
/1 
window, 
/18 
suddenly 
spread 
/59 
/11 
hand, 
/0 
/37 
a 
snatch 
in 
/1 
air. 
/147 
/56 
/114 
/8 
/433 
of 
anything, 
/23 
/18 
heard 
a 
/249 
shriek 
/0 
a 
fall, 
/0 
a 
crash 
of 
broken 
/486 
/150 
/290 
/18 
concluded 
/69 
it 
/7 
/95 
possible 
it 
/19 
/181 
/21 
a 
cucumber-frame, 
or 
something 
of 
/1 
sort. 
Next 
/304 
an 
angry 
voice--the 
Rabbit's--`Pat! 
Pat! 
Where 
/267 
you?' 
/279 
/82 
a 
voice 
/18 
/19 
/86 
heard 
before, 
`Sure 
/82 
/270 
here! 
Digging 
/34 
apples, 
yer

`Digging 
/34 
apples, 
indeed!' 
/184 
/1 
/45 
angrily. 
`Here! 
Come 
/0 
help 
me 
/59 
of 
THIS!' 
(Sounds 
of 
/479 
broken 
glass.) 
`Now 
/299 
me, 
Pat, 
what's 
/69 
in 
/1 
window?' 
`Sure, 
/323 
an 
arm, 
yer 
honour!' 
(He 
pronounced 
it 
`arrum.') 
`An 
arm, 
/194 
goose! 
Who

/142 
/151 
/69 
size? 
/165 
it 
fills 
/1 
whole 
window!' 
`Sure, 
it 
does, 
yer 
honour: 
/23 
/323 
an 
arm 
/34 
/74 
that.' 
`Well, 
/323 
/207 
no 
business 
there, 
at

rate: 
go

it 
away!' 
/52 
/7 
a 
/314 
silence 
/94 
/72 
/0 
/6 
/245 
/391

/0 
then;

/429 
`Sure, 
I 
don't

at 
all, 
at 
all!' 
/282 
as

/0 
at 
last

spread 
/59 
/11 
/296 
again,

/37 
another 
snatch 
in

air. 
This 
/73 
/141 
/138 
TWO 
/249 
shrieks, 
/0 
/479 
sounds 
of 
broken 
glass. 
/455 
a 
number 
of 
cucumber-frames 
/141 
/186 
be!' 
thought 
Alice. 
`I 
/124 
/26 
they'll 
do 
next! 
As 
/34 
pulling 
me 
/59 
of 
/1 
window, 
I 
/391 
/265 
/137 
COULD! 
/270 
sure 
I 
don't 
want

stay 
in

/360 
longer!' 
/147 
/463 
/34 
/110 
/73 
without 
hearing 
anything 
more: 
at 
last 
/304 
a 
rumbling 
of 
/249 
cartwheels, 
/0 
/1 
/232 
of 
a 
/200 
/178 
voice 
/74 
talking 
together: 
/18 
/37 
/59 
/1 
words: 
`Where's

I 
hadn't

one; 
Bill's

/1

it 
here, 
lad!--Here, 
/156 
'em 
up 
at

corner--No, 
tie

together 
first--they

Heads

(a

chimney?--Nay, 
I 
shan't! 
YOU 
do 
it!--That 
I 
won't, 
then!--Bill's 
to 
go 
down--Here, 
Bill! 
/1 
master 
says 
/243 
to 
go 
/98 
/1 
chimney!' 
`Oh! 
So 
Bill's 
/207 
to 
/176 
/98 
/1 
chimney, 
has 
he?' 
/184 
/6 
to 
herself. 
`Shy, 
/137 
/220 
to 
/156 
everything 
/145 
Bill! 
I 
wouldn't 
be 
in 
Bill's 
place 
/34 
a 
/200 
deal: 
/182 
fireplace 
is 
narrow, 
to 
be 
sure; 
/23 
I 
THINK 
I 
can 
kick 
a 
little!' 
/147 
drew 
/11 
foot 
as 
far 
/98 
/1 
chimney 
as 
/18 
/33 
/0 
/463 
till 
/18 
heard 
a 
/249 
animal 
/226 
couldn't 
guess 
of 
/26 
/198 
it 
was) 
scratching 
/0 
scrambling 
/115 
in 
/1 
chimney 
/50 
above 
her: 
then, 
/280 
to 
herself 
`This 
is 
Bill,' 
/18 
/498 
/151 
sharp 
kick, 
/0 
/463 
to 
/96 
/26 
/41 
/126 
/127 
/107 
/351 
/490 
/18 
heard 
/7 
a 
general 
chorus 
of 
`There 
goes 
Bill!' 
/82 
/1 
Rabbit's 
voice 
along--`Catch 
him, 
/194 
by 
/1 
hedge!' 
/82 
silence, 
/0 
/82 
another 
confusion 
of 
voices--`Hold 
up 
his 
head--Brandy 
now--Don't 
choke 
him--How 
/7 
/24 
old 
fellow? 
What 
happened 
to 
you? 
Tell 
us 
/74 
/115 
it!' 
Last 
/304 
a 
/249 
feeble, 
squeaking 
voice, 
(`That's 
Bill,' 
thought 
Alice,) 
`Well, 
I 
hardly 
know--No 
more, 
thank 
ye; 
/270 
better 
now--but 
/270 
a 
deal 
/133 
flustered 
to 
/299 
you--all 
I 
/392 
/238 
something 
comes 
at 
me 
/108 
a 
Jack-in-the-box, 
/0 
up 
I 
goes 
/108 
a 
sky-rocket!' 
`So 
/194 
did, 
old 
fellow!' 
/184 
/1 
others. 
`We 
/186 
/432 
/1 
house 
down!' 
/184 
/1 
Rabbit's 
voice; 
/0 
/6 
called 
/59 
as 
loud 
as 
/18 
/33 
`If 
/194 
do. 
/414 
set 
/264 
at 
you!' 
/52 
/7 
a 
dead 
silence 
instantly, 
/0 
/6 
thought 
to 
herself, 
`I 
/124 
/26 
/137 
WILL 
do 
next! 
If 
/137 
/19 
/360 
sense, 
they'd 
/92 
/1 
roof 
off.' 
/477 
a 
minute 
or 
two, 
/137 
/216 
moving 
/115 
again, 
/0 
/6 
heard 
/1 
/45 
/319 
`A 
barrowful 
/431 
/255 
to 
begin 
with.' 
`A 
barrowful 
of 
WHAT?' 
thought 
/456 
/23 
/18 
/19 
/114 
/314 
to 
doubt, 
/34 
/1 
next 
/102 
a 
shower 
of 
/249 
pebbles 
/304 
rattling 
in 
at 
/1 
window, 
/0 
/110 
of 
/236 
hit 
/11 
in 
/1 
face. 
`I'll 
/156 
a 
stop 
to 
this,' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself, 
/0 
shouted 
/475 
`You'd 
better 
/114 
do 
/69 
again!' 
/290 
produced 
another 
dead 
silence. 
/6 
noticed 
/46 
/110 
surprise 
/69 
/1 
pebbles 
/138 
/74 
turning 
/21 
/249 
cakes 
as 
/137 
lay 
on 
/1 
floor, 
/0 
a 
/383 
/210 
/304 
/21 
/11 
head. 
`If 
I 
/277 
/151 
of 
these 
cakes,' 
/18 
thought, 
`it's 
sure 
to 
/130 
SOME 
change 
in 
my 
size; 
/0 
as 
it 
can't 
possibly 
/130 
me 
larger, 
it 
/186 
/130 
me 
smaller, 
I 
suppose.' 
So 
/18 
swallowed 
/151 
of 
/1 
cakes, 
/0 
/7 
delighted 
to 
/400 
/69 
/18 
/216 
shrinking 
directly. 
As 
/256 
as 
/18 
/7 
/372 
enough 
to 
/8 
through 
/1 
/341 
/18 
/49

of

house,

/116 
/76 
a 
crowd 
of 
/249 
animals

birds 
waiting 
outside. 
/107 
/386 
/249 
Lizard, 
Bill, 
/7 
in 
/1 
middle, 
being 
held 
up 
by 
two 
guinea-pigs, 
/419 
/138 
giving 
it 
something 
/59 
of 
a 
bottle. 
They 
/74 
/37 
a 
rush 
at 
/6 
/1 
/102 
/18 
appeared; 
/23 
/18 
/49 
/167 
as 
hard 
as 
/18 
/33 
/0 
/256 
/116 
herself 
safe 
in 
a 
thick 
wood. 
`The 
/351 
/490 
/180 
/207 
to 
do,' 
/184 
/6 
to 
herself, 
as

wandered 
/115 
in 
/1 
wood, 
`is 
to

I 
/57 
/69

be

plan.' 
It 
sounded 
an 
excellent 
plan, 
no 
doubt, 
/0 
/9 
neatly 
/0 
simply 
arranged; 
/1 
/391 
difficulty

/69 
/18 
/19 
/114 
/1

/210 
/104 
to

it; 
/0 
while 
/18 
/7 
peering

anxiously 
/221 
/1 
trees, 
a 
/249 
sharp 
bark 
/95 
/68 
/11 
/385 
/37 
/11 
/123 
up 
in 
a 
/152 
/412 
An 
enormous 
puppy 
/7 
looking 
/98 
at 
/11 
/46 
/99 
/335 
eyes, 
/0 
feebly 
stretching 
/59 
/151 
paw, 
/339 
to 
touch 
/51 
`Poor 
/249 
thing!' 
/184 
/387 
in 
a 
coaxing 
tone, 
/0 
/18 
/129 
hard 
to 
whistle 
to 
it; 
/23 
/18 
/7 
terribly 
frightened 
/74 
/1 
/73 
at 
/1 
thought 
/69 
it 
/271 
be 
hungry, 
in

case 
it

be 
/9 
/170 
to 
/277 
/11 
up 
in 
spite 
of 
/74 
/11 
coaxing. 
Hardly 
knowing 
/26 
/18 
did, 
/18 
picked 
up 
a 
/249 
/309 
of 
stick, 
/0 
held 
it 
/59 
to

puppy; 
whereupon

puppy 
/311 
/21 
/1 
air 
/167 
/74 
its 
/312 
at 
once, 
/46 
a 
yelp 
of 
delight, 
/0 
rushed 
at 
/1 
stick, 
/0 
/37 
believe 
to 
worry 
it; 
/82 
/6 
dodged 
/324 
a 
/152 
thistle, 
to 
keep 
herself 
/150 
being 
run 
over; 
/0 
/1 
/102 
/18 
appeared 
on 
/1 
/424 
side, 
/1 
puppy 
/37 
another 
rush 
at 
/1 
stick, 
/0 
tumbled 
/385 
/68 
heels 
in 
its 
hurry 
to 
/8 
/433 
of 
it; 
/82 
/387 
thinking 
it 
/7 
/9 
/108 
/14 
a 
game 
of 
play 
/46 
a 
cart-horse, 
/0 
expecting

/102 
to 
be 
trampled 
/100 
its 
/84 
/49 
/335 
/1 
thistle 
again; 
/82 
/1 
puppy 
/216 
a 
series 
of 
short 
charges 
at 
/1 
stick, 
running 
a

/249 
/60 
forwards 
each 
/73 
/0 
a

/60 
back,

barking 
hoarsely 
/74

/478 
till 
at

it 
/491 
/98 
a

/60 
/293 
panting, 
/46 
its 
tongue 
hanging 
/59 
of 
its 
mouth,

its 
/152 
/48 
/398 
shut. 
This 
/75 
to 
/6 
a 
/200 
opportunity 
/34 
/40 
/11 
escape; 
so 
/18 
set 
/167 
at 
once,

/49 
till

/7 
/76 
/10 
/0 
/59 
of 
breath, 
/0 
till 
/1 
puppy's 
bark 
sounded 
/76 
faint 
in 
/1 
distance. 
/248 
yet 
/26 
a 
dear 
/249 
puppy 
it 
was!' 
/184 
/387 
as 
/18 
leant 
against 
a 
buttercup 
to 
rest 
herself, 
/0 
fanned 
herself 
/46 
/151 
of 
/1 
leaves: 
`I 
/258 
/71 
liked

it

much, 
if--if 
I'd 
/391

it! 
Oh 
/64 
I'd 
nearly 
forgotten

/180 
/207 
to 
grow 
up 
again! 
/190 
me 
see--how 
IS 
it 
to 
be 
managed? 
I 
suppose 
I 
/70 
to 
/277 
or 
/441 
something 
or 
other; 
/23 
/1 
/152

/238 
what?' 
/107 
/152

certainly 
/211

/11 
at

CHAPTER 
V 
Advice 
/150 
a 
Caterpillar 
/107 
Caterpillar 
/0 
/6 
/81 
at 
each 
/424 
/34 
/110 
/73 
in 
silence: 
at 
last 
/1 
Caterpillar 
/148 
/1 
hookah 
/59 
of 
its 
mouth, 
/0 
addressed 
/11 
in 
a 
languid, 
/39 
voice. 
`Who 
/267 
YOU?' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
This 
/7 
/114 
an 
encouraging 
opening 
/34 
a 
conversation. 
/6 
replied, 
/227 
shyly, 
`I--I 
hardly 
know, 
sir, 
/95 
at 
present-- 
at 
least 
I 
/392 
/419 
I 
/229 
/43 
I 
/207 
up 
/182 
morning, 
/23 
I 
/57 
I 
/186 
/71 
/336 
changed 
several 
times 
since 
then.' 
/455 
do 
/194 
mean 
by 
that?' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar 
sternly. 
`Explain 
yourself!' 
`I 
can't 
explain 
MYSELF, 
/270 
afraid, 
sir' 
/184 
/387 
`because 
/270 
/114 
myself, 
/194 
see.' 
`I 
don't 
see,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`I'm 
afraid 
I 
can't 
/156 
it 
/479 
clearly,' 
/6 
replied 
/9 
politely, 
/466 
I 
can't 
understand 
it 
myself 
to 
begin 
with; 
/0 
being 
so 
/178 
different 
sizes 
in 
a 
/36 
is 
/9 
confusing.' 
`It 
isn't,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Well, 
perhaps 
/194 
haven't 
/116 
it 
so 
yet,' 
/184 
/456 
`but 
/43 
/194 
/71 
to 
turn 
/21 
a 
chrysalis--you 
/431 
/110 
day, 
/194 
know--and 
/82 
/94 
/69 
/21 
a 
butterfly, 
I 
/258 
/57 
you'll 
/38 
it 
a 
/249 
queer, 
won't 
you?' 
`Not 
a 
bit,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Well, 
perhaps 
/436 
feelings 
may 
be 
different,' 
/184 
/456 
`all 
I 
/392 
/238 
it 
/41 
/38 
/9 
queer 
to 
ME.' 
`You!' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar 
contemptuously. 
`Who 
/267 
YOU?' 
Which 
brought 
/236 
/397 
again 
to 
/1 
beginning 
of 
/1 
conversation. 
/6 
/291 
a 
/249 
irritated 
at 
/1 
Caterpillar's 
/40 
/160 
/53 
short 
remarks, 
/0 
/18 
drew 
herself 
up 
/0 
/415 
/9 
gravely, 
`I 
think, 
/194 
/70 
to 
/299 
me 
/419 
YOU 
are, 
first.' 
`Why?' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
Here 
/7 
another 
puzzling 
question; 
/0 
as 
/6 
/245 
/114 
/57 
of 
/360 
/200 
reason, 
/0 
as 
/1 
Caterpillar 
/75 
to 
be 
in 
a 
/53 
unpleasant 
state 
of 
mind, 
/18 
/320 
away. 
`Come 
back!' 
/1 
Caterpillar 
called 
/94 
/51 
`I've 
something 
important 
to 
say!' 
This 
sounded 
promising, 
certainly: 
/6 
/320 
/0 
/304 
/397 
/106 
`Keep 
/436 
temper,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Is 
/69 
all?' 
/184 
/387 
swallowing 
/98 
/11 
anger 
as 
/32 
as 
/18 
could. 
`No,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
/6 
thought 
/18 
/271 
as 
/32 
wait, 
as 
/18 
/19 
nothing 
/254 
to 
/255 
/0 
perhaps 
/94 
/74 
it 
/271 
/299 
/11 
something 
/42 
hearing. 
For 
/110 
minutes 
it 
puffed 
/317 
without 
speaking, 
/23 
at 
last 
it 
unfolded 
its 
arms, 
/148 
/1 
hookah 
/59 
of 
its 
mouth 
again, 
/0 
/415 
`So 
/194 
/57 
/243 
changed, 
do 
you?' 
`I'm 
afraid 
I 
am,

I

/34

`Can't

/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Well,

DOTH

LITTLE 
BUSY 
BEE," 
/23 
it

replied 
in 
a

melancholy 
voice. 
`Repeat, 
"YOU 
ARE 
OLD, 
FATHER 
WILLIAM,"' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
/6 
folded 
/11 
hands,

began:-- 
`You 
/267 
old, 
Father 
William,' 
/1 
young 
man

white;

incessantly 
stand 
on

head-- 
Do 
/194 
think, 
at 
/436 
age, 
it 
is 
right?' 
`In 
my 
youth,' 
Father 
William 
replied 
to 
his 
son, 
`I 
feared 
it 
/271 
injure 
/1 
brain; 
But, 
/457 
/69 
/270 
perfectly 
sure 
I

none,

again.' 
`You

old,' 
/184 
/1 
youth,

I 
mentioned 
before,

a 
back-somersault 
in 
at

Pray,

is

reason

that?' 
`In 
my 
youth,'

/1 
sage, 
as 
he 
shook 
his 
grey 
locks, 
`I 
kept

my

supple 
By

of

ointment--one 
shilling

`You

youth,

bones

/1

Pray 
/104 
/56 
/194 
/246 
to 
do 
it?' 
`In 
my 
youth,' 
/184 
his 
father, 
`I 
/148 
to 
/1 
law, 
/279 
argued 
each 
case

my

it

`You

balanced 
an

nose-- 
What 
/37 
/194 
so 
awfully 
clever?' 
`I 
/71 
answered 
three

/69 
is

Said 
his

`don't 
give

stairs!' 
`That 
is

/184 
right,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Not 
QUITE 
right, 
/270 
afraid,' 
/184 
/387 
timidly; 
`some 
of

/214 
/71 
/207 
altered.' 
`It

beginning 
to 
end,'

Caterpillar 
decidedly,

/351 
to

/455 
/461 
do

want 
to 
be?' 
it 
asked. 
`Oh, 
/270 
/114 
particular 
as 
to 
size,' 
/6 
hastily 
replied; 
`only

`I 
DON'T

Caterpillar. 
/6 
/184 
nothing:

contradicted 
in

losing

`Are

/184 
/1 
Caterpillar. 
`Well, 
I

/108 
to

a

sir, 
if

wouldn't

/184 
Alice:

`It 
is 
a

height 
indeed!' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar 
angrily, 
rearing 
itself 
upright 
as 
it 
spoke 
/449 
/7 
exactly 
three 
/367 
high). 
`But 
/270 
/114 
used 
to 
it!' 
pleaded 
/386 
/6 
in 
a 
piteous 
tone. 
/279 
/18 
thought 
of 
herself, 
`I

creatures 
wouldn't 
be 
so 
easily 
offended!' 
`You'll

its

/463 
patiently 
until

hookah 
/59 
of

yawned

or 
twice,

shook 
itself. 
Then 
it 
/207 
/98 
/167 
/1 
mushroom, 
/0 
crawled 
/317 
in 
/1 
grass, 
merely 
remarking 
as 
it 
went, 
`One 
/337 
/431

taller,

/1 
/424

grow 
shorter.' 
`One 
/337 
of 
WHAT? 
/107 
/424 
/337 
of 
WHAT?' 
thought 
/6 
to 
herself. 
`Of 
/1 
mushroom,' 
/184 
/1 
Caterpillar, 
/95 
as 
if 
/18 
/19 
asked 
it 
aloud; 
/0 
in 
another 
/102 
it

/59 
of 
sight. 
/6 
remained 
looking 
thoughtfully 
at 
/1 
mushroom 
/34 
a 
minute, 
/339 
to 
/130 
/59 
/290 
/138 
/1 
two

of 
it;

as 
it 
/7 
perfectly 
/365 
/18 
/116 
/182 
a

difficult 
question. 
However, 
at 
last 
/18 
stretched 
/11 
arms 
/335 
it 
as 
far 
as 
/137 
/41

broke

/248 
/457 
/290 
is 
which?' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself, 
/0 
nibbled 
a 
/249 
of 
/1 
right-hand 
/309 
to 
try 
/1 
effect: 
/1 
next 
/102 
/18 
/291 
a 
violent 
blow 
underneath 
/11 
chin: 
it 
/19 
struck 
/11 
foot! 
/147 
/7 
a 
/200 
deal 
frightened 
by 
/182 
/9 
sudden 
change, 
/23

/141 
/7 
no

as 
/18 
/7 
shrinking 
rapidly; 
so 
/18 
set 
to 
work 
at

to 
/277 
/110 
of 
/1 
/424 
bit. 
Her 
chin

pressed 
so 
closely 
against

foot,

/141 
/7 
hardly 
room 
to

/184 
/6 
in 
a

of 
delight,

changed

alarm 
in 
another 
moment, 
/43 
/18 
/116 
/69 
/11 
shoulders

nowhere

found: 
/74 
/18 
/245 
/195 
/43 
/18 
/81 
/113 
/7 
an 
immense 
length 
of 
neck,

/75 
to 
rise 
/108 
a 
stalk 
/59 
of 
a 
sea 
of 
green 
leaves 
/69 
lay 
far 
below 
/51 
/455 
CAN

green

/184 
Alice. 
/248 
where

to? 
/279 
oh, 
my

hands,

is 
it 
I 
can't 
/96 
you?' 
/147 
/7 
moving

/115 
as

spoke,

no 
result

to

/347 
a

shaking

distant 
green 
leaves. 
As

/75 
to

no

up

to 
them,

delighted 
to

/403 
/41 
bend 
/115 
easily 
in 
/360 
direction, 
/108 
a 
serpent. 
/147 
/19 
/95 
succeeded 
in 
curving 
it 
/98 
/21 
a 
graceful 
zigzag,

/7 
/125 
to 
dive 
in

tops 
of

trees 
/100 
/290 
/18 
/19 
/336 
wandering, 
/43 
a 
sharp 
hiss

/11 
draw 
/397 
in 
a 
hurry: 
a 
/99 
pigeon 
/19 
flown

/11 
face, 
/0 
/7 
beating 
/11 
violently 
/46 
its 
wings. 
`Serpent!' 
screamed

Pigeon. 
`I'm 
/446 
a 
serpent!' 
/184 
/6 
indignantly. 
`Let 
me 
alone!' 
`Serpent, 
I 
/62 
again!' 
repeated 
/1 
Pigeon, 
/23 
in 
a 
/479 
subdued 
tone, 
/0 
added 
/46 
a 
kind 
of 
sob, 
`I've 
/129

/111 
/0 
nothing 
seems 
to 
suit 
them!' 
`I 
haven't

talking

/184 
Alice. 
`I've

/129 
banks,

/180 
/129 
hedges,' 
/1 
Pigeon 
/103 
/83 
without 
attending 
to 
her; 
`but 
/381 
serpents! 
There's 
no 
pleasing 
them!' 
/6 
/7 
/479 
/0 
/479 
puzzled, 
/23 
/18 
thought 
/141 
/7 
no 
/27 
in 
/280 
anything 
/479 
till 
/1 
Pigeon 
/19 
finished. 
`As 
if 
it 
wasn't 
trouble 
enough 
hatching

eggs,' 
/184 
/1 
Pigeon; 
`but 
I

be 
on

look-out

I 
haven't

a

of 
sleep 
these 
three 
weeks!' 
`I'm 
/9 
sorry 
you've 
/336 
annoyed,' 
/184 
/387 
/419 
/7 
beginning 
to 
/96 
its 
meaning. 
/248 
/95 
as 
I'd 
taken 
/1 
highest 
tree 
in 
/1 
wood,' 
continued 
/1 
Pigeon, 
raising 
its 
voice 
to 
a 
shriek, 
/25 
/95 
as 
I 
/7 
thinking 
I 
/258 
be 
free 
of

at 
last,

/186 
needs 
/176 
wriggling

Ugh, 
Serpent!' 
`But 
/270 
/446 
a 
serpent, 
I 
/299 
you!' 
/184 
Alice. 
`I'm 
a--I'm 
a--' 
`Well! 
WHAT 
/267 
you?' 
/184 
/1 
Pigeon. 
`I 
can 
/96 
/243 
/339 
to 
invent 
something!' 
`I--I'm 
a 
/249 
girl,' 
/184 
/387 
/227 
doubtfully, 
as 
/18 
remembered 
/1 
number 
of 
changes 
/18 
/19 
gone 
through 
/69 
day. 
`A 
/170 
story 
indeed!' 
/184 
/1 
Pigeon 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
/1 
deepest 
contempt. 
`I've 
/88 
a

/23 
/86 
ONE

a

as 
that! 
/252 
no! 
You're 
a 
serpent;

there's 
no 
/27 
denying

I 
suppose 
you'll 
be

me 
next

`I 
HAVE

/387 
/419 
/7 
a

truthful

`I

This

/160 
a

to

silent

a 
minute 
or

adding, 
`You're 
looking

/32 
enough;

it

`Well,

/184 
/1 
Pigeon 
in

its

succeeded 
in 
bringing 
herself 
/98 
to 
/11 
usual 
height. 
It 
/7 
so 
/314 
since 
/18 
/19 
/336 
anything 
/187 
/1 
/206 
size, 
/69 
it 
/291 
/76 
strange 
at 
first; 
/23 
/18 
/207 
used 
to 
it 
in 
a 
/394 
minutes, 
/0 
/216 
talking 
to 
herself, 
as 
usual. 
/493 
there's 
/398 
my 
plan 
done 
now! 
/162 
puzzling 
/74 
these 
changes 
are! 
/270 
/86 
sure 
/26 
/270 
/125 
to 
be, 
/150 
/151 
minute 
to 
another! 
However, 
/180 
/207 
/397 
to 
my 
/206 
size: 
/1 
next 
/490 
/238 
to 
/8 
/21 
/69 
beautiful 
garden--how 
IS 
/69 
to 
be 
done, 
I 
wonder?' 
As 
/18 
/184 
/72 
/18 
/304 
suddenly 
/145 
an 
/362 
place, 
/46 
a 
/249 
house 
in 
it 
/115 
/192 
/312 
high. 
`Whoever 
lives 
there,' 
thought 
/387 
`it'll 
/86 
do 
to 
/176 
/145 
/236 
THIS 
size: 
why, 
I 
/258 
frighten 
/236 
/59 
of 
/224 
wits!' 
So 
/18 
/216 
nibbling 
at 
/1 
righthand 
/309 
again, 
/0 
/56 
/114 
venture 
to 
go 
/187 
/1 
house 
till 
/18 
/19 
brought 
herself 
/98 
to 
nine 
/367 
high. 
CHAPTER 
VI 
Pig 
/0 
Pepper 
For 
a 
minute 
or 
two 
/18 
stood 
looking 
at 
/1 
house, 
/0 
wondering 
/26 
to 
do 
next, 
/43 
suddenly 
a 
footman 
in 
livery 
/304 
running 
/59 
of 
/1 
wood--(she 
considered 
him 
to 
be 
a 
footman 
because 
he 
/7 
in 
livery: 
otherwise, 
judging 
by 
his 
/460 
only, 
/18 
/41 
/71 
called 
him 
a 
fish)--and 
rapped 
loudly 
at 
/1 
/366 
/46 
his 
knuckles. 
It 
/7 
/370 
by 
another 
footman 
in 
livery, 
/46 
a 
/335 
face, 
/0 
/99 
/48 
/108 
a 
frog; 
/0 
both 
footmen, 
/6 
noticed, 
/19 
powdered 
hair 
/69 
curled 
/74 
/68 
/224 
heads. 
/147 
/291 
/9 
curious 
to 
/392 
/26 
it 
/7 
/74 
about, 
/0 
crept 
a 
/249 
/60 
/59 
of 
/1 
wood 
to 
listen. 
/107 
Fish-Footman 
/216 
by 
producing 
/150 
/100 
his 
arm 
a 
/152 
letter, 
nearly 
as 
/99 
as 
himself, 
/0 
/182 
he 
handed 
/68 
to 
/1 
/338 
saying, 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone, 
`For 
/1 
Duchess. 
An 
invitation 
/150 
/1 
Queen 
to 
play 
croquet.' 
/107 
Frog-Footman 
repeated, 
in 
/1 
same 
solemn 
tone, 
/391 
changing 
/1 
order 
of 
/1 
/214 
a 
little, 
`From 
/1 
Queen. 
An 
invitation 
/34 
/1 
Duchess 
to 
play 
croquet.' 
Then 
/137 
both 
bowed 
low, 
/0 
/224 
curls 
/207 
entangled 
together. 
/6 
laughed 
so 
/58 
at 
/72 
/69 
/18 
/19 
to 
run 
/397 
/21 
/1 
wood 
/34 
/155 
of 
/224 
hearing 
her; 
/0 
/43 
/18 
next 
/20 
/59 
/1 
Fish-Footman 
/7 
gone, 
/0 
/1 
/424 
/7 
sitting 
on 
/1 
ground 
/187 
/1 
/341 
staring 
stupidly 
up 
/21 
/1 
sky. 
/6 
/103 
timidly 
up 
to 
/1 
/341 
/0 
knocked. 
`There's 
no 
/198 
of 
/27 
in 
knocking,' 
/184 
/1 
Footman, 
/25 
/69 
/34 
two 
reasons. 
/128 
because 
/270 
on 
/1 
same 
/337 
of 
/1 
/366 
as 
/194 
are; 
secondly, 
because 
they're 
/40 
/160 
a 
noise 
inside, 
no 
/151 
/245 
possibly 
/61 
you.' 
/279 
certainly 
/141 
/7 
a 
most 
extraordinary 
noise 
/125 
on 
within--a 
constant 
howling 
/0 
sneezing, 
/0 
/340 
/457 
/0 
/82 
a 
/152 
crash, 
as 
if 
a 
dish 
or 
kettle 
/19 
/336 
broken 
to 
pieces. 
`Please, 
then,' 
/184 
/387 
`how 
am 
I 
to 
/8 
in?' 
`There 
/271 
be 
/110 
sense 
in 
/436 
knocking,' 
/1 
Footman 
/103 
on 
without 
attending 
to 
/202 
`if 
we 
/19 
/1 
/366 
between 
us. 
For 
instance, 
if 
/194 
/138 
INSIDE, 
/194 
/271 
knock, 
/0 
I 
/245 
let 
/194 
/475 
/194 
know.' 
He 
/7 
looking 
up 
/21 
/1 
sky 
/74 
/1 
/73 
he 
/7 
speaking, 
/0 
/182 
/6 
thought 
decidedly 
uncivil. 
`But 
perhaps 
he 
can't 
help 
it,' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself; 
`his 
/48 
/267 
so 
/53 
nearly 
at 
/1 
/168 
of 
his 
head. 
/275 
at 
/360 
/361 
he 
/271 
/288 
questions.--How 
am 
I 
to 
/8 
in?' 
/18 
repeated, 
/185 
`I 
/65 
sit 
here,' 
/1 
Footman 
remarked, 
`till 
tomorrow--' 
At 
/182 
/102 
/1 
/366 
of 
/1 
house 
opened, 
/0 
a 
/99 
plate 
/304 
skimming 
/475 
straight 
at 
/1 
Footman's 
head: 
it 
/95 
grazed 
his 
nose, 
/0 
broke 
to 
pieces 
against 
/151 
of 
/1 
trees 
/324 
him. 
`--or 
next 
day, 
maybe,' 
/1 
Footman 
continued 
in 
/1 
same 
tone, 
exactly 
as 
if 
nothing 
/19 
happened. 
`How 
am 
I 
to 
/8 
in?' 
asked 
/6 
again, 
in 
a 
louder 
tone. 
`ARE 
/194 
to 
/8 
in 
at 
all?' 
/184 
/1 
Footman. 
`That's 
/1 
/351 
question, 
/194 
know.' 
It 
/211 
no 
doubt: 
/391 
/6 
/56 
/114 
/108 
to 
be 
told 
so. 
`It's 
/396 
dreadful,' 
/18 
muttered 
to 
herself, 
`the 
/60 
/74 
/1 
creatures 
argue. 
It's 
enough 
to 
drive 
/151 
crazy!' 
/107 
Footman 
/75 
to 
/57 
/182 
a 
/200 
opportunity 
/34 
repeating 
his 
remark, 
/46 
variations. 
`I 
/65 
sit 
here,' 
he 
/415 
`on 
/0 
/293 
/34 
days 
/0 
days.' 
`But 
/26 
am 
I 
to 
do?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Anything 
/194 
like,' 
/184 
/1 
Footman, 
/0 
/216 
whistling. 
`Oh, 
there's 
no 
/27 
in 
talking 
to 
him,' 
/184 
/6 
desperately: 
`he's 
perfectly 
idiotic!' 
/279 
/18 
/370 
/1 
/366 
/0 
/103 
in. 
/107 
/366 
/371 
/206 
/21 
a 
/99 
kitchen, 
/290 
/7 
full 
of 
smoke 
/150 
/151 
end 
to 
/1 
other: 
/1 
Duchess 
/7 
sitting 
on 
a 
three-legged 
stool 
in 
/1 
middle, 
nursing 
a 
baby; 
/1 
cook 
/7 
leaning 
/68 
/1 
fire, 
stirring 
a 
/99 
cauldron 
/290 
/75 
to 
be 
full 
of 
soup. 
`There's 
certainly 
/133 
/58 
pepper 
in 
/69 
soup!' 
/6 
/184 
to 
herself, 
as 
/32 
as 
/18 
/245 
/34 
sneezing. 
/52 
/7 
certainly 
/133 
/58 
of 
it 
in 
/1 
air. 
Even 
/1 
Duchess 
sneezed 
occasionally; 
/0 
as 
/34 
/1 
baby, 
it 
/7 
sneezing 
/0 
howling 
alternately 
without 
a 
moment's 
pause. 
/107 
/391 
/197 
in 
/1 
kitchen 
/69 
/56 
/114 
sneeze, 
/138 
/1 
cook, 
/0 
a 
/99 
cat 
/290 
/7 
sitting 
on 
/1 
hearth 
/0 
grinning 
/150 
ear 
to 
ear. 
`Please 
/41 
/194 
/299 
/409 
/184 
/387 
a 
/249 
timidly, 
/34 
/18 
/7 
/114 
/76 
sure 
whether 
it 
/7 
/200 
manners 
/34 
/11 
to 
speak 
first, 
`why 
/436 
cat 
grins 
/108 
that?' 
`It's 
a 
Cheshire 
cat,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess, 
/25 
/205 
why. 
Pig!' 
/147 
/184 
/1 
last 
word 
/46 
/160 
sudden 
violence 
/69 
/6 
/76 
jumped; 
/23 
/18 
/142 
in 
another 
/102 
/69 
it 
/7 
addressed 
to 
/1 
baby, 
/0 
/114 
to 
/202 
so 
/18 
/148 
courage, 
/0 
/103 
on 
again:-- 
`I 
/231 
/392 
/69 
Cheshire 
/276 
always 
grinned; 
in 
/451 
I 
/231 
/392 
/69 
/276 
COULD 
grin.' 
`They 
/74 
can,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess; 
/25 
most 
of 
'em 
do.' 
`I 
don't 
/392 
of 
/360 
/69 
do,' 
/6 
/184 
/9 
politely, 
feeling 
/76 
pleased 
to 
/71 
/207 
/21 
a 
conversation. 
`You 
don't 
/392 
much,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess; 
/25 
/205 
a 
fact.' 
/6 
/56 
/114 
at 
/74 
/108 
/1 
tone 
of 
/182 
remark, 
/0 
thought 
it 
/41 
be 
as 
/32 
to 
introduce 
/110 
/424 
subject 
of 
conversation. 
While 
/18 
/7 
/339 
to 
fix 
on 
one, 
/1 
cook 
/148 
/1 
cauldron 
of 
soup 
/167 
/1 
fire, 
/0 
at 
/16 
set 
to 
work 
throwing 
everything 
within 
/11 
/484 
at 
/1 
Duchess 
/0 
/1 
baby 
--the 
fire-irons 
/304 
first; 
/82 
followed 
a 
shower 
of 
saucepans, 
plates, 
/0 
dishes. 
/107 
Duchess 
/148 
no 
notice 
of 
/236 
/166 
/43 
/137 
hit 
her; 
/0 
/1 
baby 
/7 
howling 
so 
/58 
already, 
/69 
it 
/7 
/76 
impossible 
to 
/62 
whether 
/1 
blows 
hurt 
it 
or 
not. 
`Oh, 
PLEASE 
/30 
/26 
/243 
doing!' 
cried 
/387 
jumping 
up 
/0 
/98 
in 
an 
agony 
of 
terror. 
`Oh, 
/141 
goes 
his 
PRECIOUS 
nose'; 
as 
an 
unusually 
/99 
saucepan 
flew 
/50 
by 
/24 
/0 
/9 
nearly 
carried 
it 
/454 
`If 
everybody 
minded 
/224 
/29 
business,' 
/1 
Duchess 
/184 
in 
a 
hoarse 
growl, 
`the 
/105 
/41 
go 
/335 
a 
deal 
faster 
/374 
it 
does.' 
`Which 
/41 
/446 
be 
an 
advantage,' 
/184 
/387 
/419 
/291 
/9 
/228 
to 
/8 
an 
opportunity 
of 
showing 
/167 
a 
/249 
of 
/11 
knowledge. 
`Just 
/57 
of 
/26 
work 
it 
/41 
/130 
/46 
/1 
/36 
/0 
night! 
You 
/96 
/1 
earth 
takes 
twenty-four 
hours 
to 
turn 
/335 
on 
its 
axis--' 
`Talking 
of 
axes,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess, 
`chop 
/167 
/11 
head!' 
/6 
glanced 
/227 
anxiously 
at 
/1 
cook, 
to 
/96 
if 
/18 
meant 
to 
/92 
/1 
hint; 
/23 
/1 
cook 
/7 
busily 
stirring 
/1 
soup, 
/0 
/75 
/114 
to 
be 
listening, 
so 
/18 
/103 
on 
again: 
`Twenty-four 
hours, 
I 
THINK; 
or 
is 
it 
twelve? 
I--' 
`Oh, 
don't 
bother 
ME,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess; 
`I 
/86 
/245 
abide 
figures!' 
/279 
/46 
/69 
/18 
/216 
nursing 
/11 
child 
again, 
singing 
a 
/198 
of 
lullaby 
to 
it 
as 
/18 
/56 
so, 
/0 
giving 
it 
a 
violent 
shake 
at 
/1 
end 
of 
/340 
line: 
`Speak 
roughly 
to

boy,

him

sneezes: 
He 
/391

it 
to 
annoy, 
Because 
he 
knows 
it 
teases.' 
CHORUS. 
(In 
/290 
/1 
cook 
/0 
/1 
baby 
joined):-- 
`Wow! 
wow! 
wow!' 
While 
/1 
Duchess 
sang 
/1 
/364 
verse 
of 
/1 
song, 
/18 
kept 
tossing

violently 
up

hardly

words:-- 
`I

CHORUS. 
`Wow! 
wow! 
wow!' 
`Here! 
/194 
may 
nurse 
it 
a 
bit, 
if

like!' 
/1 
Duchess 
/184 
to 
/387 
flinging 
/1 
baby 
at 
/11 
as 
/18 
spoke. 
`I

Queen,' 
/0 
/18 
hurried

of

cook 
threw 
a 
frying-pan 
/94

as

`But

no

`If

/387 
seriously, 
`I'll

nothing

you. 
Mind 
now!' 
/107 
/386 
/249

alarm. 
This

to

a

pig, 
I

/43 
/18 
/7 
a 
/249 
startled 
by 
seeing

Cheshire 
Cat 
sitting 
on 
a 
bough 
of 
a 
tree 
a 
/394 
yards 
/454 
/107 
Cat 
/391 
grinned 
/43 
it 
/142 
Alice. 
It 
/81 
good- 
natured, 
/18 
thought: 
/203 
it

/53 
/314 
claws

teeth, 
so 
/18 
/291 
/69 
it 
/70 
to 
be 
treated

`Cheshire 
Puss,' 
/18 
began, 
/227 
timidly, 
as 
/18 
/56 
/114 
at 
/74 
/392 
whether 
it 
/41 
/108

however, 
it 
/391 
grinned 
a 
/249 
wider. 
/493 
/323 
pleased 
so 
far,' 
thought 
/387 
/0 
/18 
/103 
on. 
`Would

/299 
me, 
please,

here?' 
`That 
depends 
a

/184 
/1 
Cat. 
`I

/184 
Alice. 
`Then 
it

/184 
/1 
Cat. 
`--so 
/314 
as 
I

SOMEWHERE,'

added 
as 
an 
explanation. 
`Oh,

sure 
to 
do 
that,'

Cat,

another 
question.

`But 
I 
don't

remarked. 
`Oh,

can't

that,' 
/184 
/1 
Cat: 
`we're

mad. 
You're 
mad.' 
`How

/270 
mad?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`You

proved

/243 
mad?' 
`To

with,' 
/184 
/1 
Cat, 
`a 
dog's 
/114 
mad. 
You 
grant 
that?' 
`I 
suppose 
so,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Well, 
then,' 
/1 
Cat 
/103 
/83 
`you 
/195

/323 
angry,

Now 
I

Therefore

`I

Alice. 
`Call

`You'll

Cat,

/114 
/58 
surprised 
at

getting 
so 
used 
to 
queer

happening. 
While

it

`By-the-bye,

/184 
/1 
Cat. 
`I'd 
nearly

`It

a

quietly

as

/62 
pig,

Cat. 
`I

`All

Cat;

`Well! 
/180 
often 
/88 
a 
cat 
without

thought 
/456 
`but 
a

It's

/19 
/114 
gone

No

cried

`There's 
PLENTY

indignantly,

`Have

`I

wine,' 
/18 
remarked. 
`There 
isn't 
any,' 
/184 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
`Then 
it 
wasn't

civil 
of

to 
offer 
it,'

/6 
angrily. 
`It 
wasn't

to

March

`I

`Your

Hatter.

Alice. 
`I'm

`Exactly 
so,'

Alice. 
`Then

March 
Hare

on. 
`I

hastily 
replied;

`Not

Hatter. 
`You

/271 
/95 
as 
/32 
say,' 
added 
/1 
March 
Hare, 
`that 
"I 
/108 
/26 
I 
get" 
is 
/1 
same 
/490 
as 
"I

/26 
I 
like"!' 
`You 
/271 
/95 
as 
/32 
say,' 
added 
/1 
Dormouse, 
/419 
/75 
to 
be 
talking 
in 
his 
sleep, 
`that 
"I 
breathe 
/43 
I 
sleep" 
is 
/1 
same 
/490 
as 
"I 
sleep 
/43 
I 
breathe"!' 
`It 
IS 
/1 
same 
/490 
/46 
you,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter, 
/0 
/140 
/1 
conversation 
dropped, 
/0 
/1 
party 
/491 
silent 
/34 
a 
minute, 
while 
/6 
thought 
/68 
/74 
/18 
/245 
remember 
/115 
ravens 
/0 
writing-desks, 
/290 
wasn't 
much. 
/107 
Hatter 
/7 
/1 
/351 
to 
break 
/1 
silence. 
/455 
/36 
of 
/1 
month 
is 
it?' 
he 
/415 
turning 
to 
Alice: 
he 
/19 
taken 
his 
/91 
/59 
of 
his 
pocket, 
/0 
/7 
looking 
at 
it 
uneasily, 
shaking 
it 
/340 
/457 
/0 
then, 
/0 
holding 
it 
to 
his 
ear. 
/6 
considered 
a 
little, 
/0 
/82 
/184 
`The 
fourth.' 
`Two 
days 
wrong!' 
sighed 
/1 
Hatter. 
`I 
told 
/194 
butter 
wouldn't 
suit 
/1 
works!' 
he 
added 
looking 
angrily 
at 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
`It 
/7 
/1 
BEST 
butter,' 
/1 
March 
Hare 
meekly 
replied. 
`Yes, 
/23 
/110 
crumbs 
/186 
/71 
/207 
in 
as 
well,' 
/1 
Hatter 
grumbled: 
`you 
shouldn't 
/71 
/156 
it 
in 
/46 
/1 
bread-knife.' 
/107 
March 
Hare 
/148 
/1 
/91 
/0 
/81 
at 
it 
gloomily: 
/82 
he 
/112 
it 
/21 
his 
cup 
of 
tea, 
/0 
/81 
at 
it 
again: 
/23 
he 
/245 
/57 
of 
nothing 
better 
to 
/62 
/374 
his 
/351 
remark, 
`It 
/7 
/1 
BEST 
butter, 
/194 
know.' 
/6 
/19 
/336 
looking 
/68 
his 
shoulder 
/46 
/110 
curiosity. 
/455 
a 
/218 
watch!' 
/18 
remarked. 
`It 
tells 
/1 
/36 
of 
/1 
month, 
/0 
doesn't 
/299 
/26 
o'clock 
it 
is!' 
`Why 
/258 
it?' 
muttered 
/1 
Hatter. 
`Does 
YOUR 
/91 
/299 
/194 
/26 
year 
it 
is?' 
`Of 
course 
not,' 
/6 
replied 
/9 
readily: 
`but 
/205 
because 
it 
stays 
/1 
same 
year 
/34 
/160 
a 
/314 
/73 
together.' 
`Which 
is 
/95 
/1 
case 
/46 
MINE,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
/6 
/291 
dreadfully 
puzzled. 
/107 
Hatter's 
remark 
/75 
to 
/71 
no 
/198 
of 
meaning 
in 
/24 
/0 
yet 
it 
/7 
certainly 
English. 
`I 
don't 
/76 
understand 
you,' 
/18 
/415 
as 
politely 
as 
/18 
could. 
`The 
Dormouse 
is 
asleep 
again,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter, 
/0 
he 
poured 
a 
/249 
/35 
tea 
/145 
its 
nose. 
/107 
Dormouse 
shook 
its 
/385 
impatiently, 
/0 
/415 
without 
opening 
its 
eyes, 
`Of 
course, 
of 
course; 
/95 
/26 
I 
/7 
/125 
to 
remark 
myself.' 
`Have 
/194 
guessed 
/1 
riddle 
yet?' 
/1 
Hatter 
/415 
turning 
to 
/6 
/106 
/413 
I 
give 
it 
up,' 
/6 
replied: 
`what's 
/1 
answer?' 
`I 
haven't 
/1 
slightest 
idea,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
`Nor 
I,' 
/184 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
/6 
sighed 
wearily. 
`I 
/57 
/194 
/271 
do 
something 
better 
/46 
/1 
time,' 
/18 
/415 
`than 
waste 
it 
in 
asking 
riddles 
/69 
/71 
no 
answers.' 
`If 
/194 
knew 
Time 
as 
/32 
as 
I 
do,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter, 
`you 
wouldn't 
talk 
/115 
wasting 
IT. 
It's 
HIM.' 
`I 
don't 
/392 
/26 
/194 
mean,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Of 
course 
/194 
don't!' 
/1 
Hatter 
/415 
tossing 
his 
/385 
contemptuously. 
`I 
dare 
/62 
/194 
/86 
/166 
spoke 
to 
Time!' 
`Perhaps 
not,' 
/6 
cautiously 
replied: 
`but 
I 
/392 
I 
/71 
to 
beat 
/73 
/43 
I 
learn 
music.' 
`Ah! 
/69 
accounts 
/34 
it,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
`He 
won't 
stand 
beating. 
Now, 
if 
/194 
/391 
kept 
on 
/200 
terms 
/46 
him, 
he'd 
do 
/442 
anything 
/194 
liked 
/46 
/1 
clock. 
For 
instance, 
suppose 
it 
/138 
nine 
o'clock 
in 
/1 
morning, 
/95 
/73 
to 
begin 
lessons: 
you'd 
/391 
/71 
to 
whisper 
a 
hint 
to 
Time, 
/0 
/335 
goes 
/1 
clock 
in 
a 
twinkling! 
Half-past 
one, 
/73 
/34 
dinner!' 
(`I 
/391 
/265 
it 
was,' 
/1 
March 
Hare 
/184 
to 
itself 
in 
a 
whisper.) 
`That 
/41 
be 
grand, 
certainly,' 
/184 
/6 
thoughtfully: 
`but 
then--I 
shouldn't 
be 
hungry 
/34 
/24 
/194 
know.' 
`Not 
at 
first, 
perhaps,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter: 
`but 
/194 
/245 
keep 
it 
to 
half-past 
/151 
as 
/314 
as 
/194 
liked.' 
`Is 
/69 
/1 
/60 
YOU 
manage?' 
/6 
asked. 
/107 
Hatter 
shook 
his 
/385 
mournfully. 
`Not 
I!' 
he 
replied. 
`We 
quarrelled 
last 
March--just 
/87 
HE 
/103 
mad, 
/194 
know--' 
(pointing 
/46 
his 
tea 
spoon 
at 
/1 
March 
Hare,) 
`--it 
/7 
at 
/1 
/152 
concert 
given 
by 
/1 
Queen 
of 
Hearts, 
/0 
I 
/19 
to 
sing 
"Twinkle, 
twinkle, 
/249 
bat! 
/162 
I 
/124 
/26 
/243 
at!" 
You 
/392 
/1 
song, 
perhaps?' 
`I've 
heard 
something 
/108 
it,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`It 
goes 
/83 
/194 
/468 
/1 
Hatter 
continued, 
/469 
/182 
way:-- 
"Up 
above 
/1 
/105 
/194 
fly, 
Like 
a 
tea-tray 
in 
/1 
sky. 
Twinkle, 
twinkle--"' 
Here 
/1 
Dormouse 
shook 
itself, 
/0 
/216 
singing 
in 
its 
sleep 
`Twinkle, 
twinkle, 
twinkle, 
twinkle--' 
/0 
/103 
on 
so 
/314 
/69 
/137 
/19 
to 
pinch 
it 
to 
/130 
it 
stop. 
`Well, 
I'd 
hardly 
finished 
/1 
/351 
verse,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter, 
`when 
/1 
Queen 
/311 
up 
/0 
bawled 
/475 
"He's 
murdering 
/1 
time! 
Off 
/46 
his 
head!"' 
`How 
dreadfully 
savage!' 
exclaimed 
Alice. 
/248 
/301 
since 
that,' 
/1 
Hatter 
/103 
on 
in 
a 
mournful 
tone, 
`he 
won't 
do 
a 
/490 
I 
ask! 
It's 
always 
six 
o'clock 
now.' 
A 
/383 
/210 
/304 
/21 
Alice's 
head. 
`Is 
/69 
/1 
reason 
so 
/178 
tea-things 
/267 
/156 
/59 
here?' 
/18 
asked. 
`Yes, 
/205 
it,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter 
/46 
a 
sigh: 
`it's 
always 
tea-time, 
/0 
we've 
no 
/73 
to 
wash 
/1 
/197 
between 
whiles.' 
`Then 
/194 
keep 
moving 
/365 
I 
suppose?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Exactly 
so,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter: 
`as 
/1 
/197 
/8 
used 
up.' 
`But 
/26 
happens 
/43 
/194 
/176 
to 
/1 
beginning 
again?' 
/6 
ventured 
to 
ask. 
`Suppose 
we 
change 
/1 
subject,' 
/1 
March 
Hare 
interrupted, 
yawning. 
`I'm 
getting 
/10 
of 
this. 
I 
vote 
/1 
young 
lady 
tells 
us 
a 
story.' 
`I'm 
afraid 
I 
don't 
/392 
one,' 
/184 
/387 
/227 
alarmed 
at 
/1 
proposal. 
`Then 
/1 
Dormouse 
shall!' 
/137 
both 
/492 
`Wake 
/313 
Dormouse!' 
/279 
/137 
pinched 
it 
on 
both 
/135 
at 
once. 
/107 
Dormouse 
slowly 
/370 
his 
eyes. 
`I 
wasn't 
asleep,' 
he 
/184 
in 
a 
hoarse, 
feeble 
voice: 
`I 
heard 
/340 
word 
/194 
fellows 
/138 
saying.' 
`Tell 
us 
a 
story!' 
/184 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
`Yes, 
please 
do!' 
pleaded 
Alice. 
/248 
be 
quick 
/115 
it,' 
added 
/1 
Hatter, 
`or 
you'll 
be 
asleep 
again 
/87 
/323 
done.' 
`Once 
/145 
a 
/73 
/141 
/138 
three

/1 
Dormouse 
/216 
in 
a

hurry; 
/25 
/224 
names 
/138 
Elsie, 
Lacie, 
/0 
Tillie; 
/0 
/137 
lived 
at 
/1 
bottom 
of 
a 
well--' 
/455 
/56 
/137 
live 
on?' 
/184 
/387 
/419 
always 
/148 
a 
/152 
interest 
in 
questions 
of 
eating 
/0 
drinking. 
`They 
lived 
on 
treacle,' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse, 
/94 
thinking 
a 
minute 
or 
two. 
`They 
couldn't 
/71 
done 
/440 
/194 
/468 
/6 
gently 
remarked; 
`they'd 
/71 
/336 
ill.' 
`So 
/137 
were,' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse; 
`VERY 
ill.' 
/6 
/129 
to 
/471 
to 
herself 
/26 
/160 
an 
extraordinary 
ways 
of 
living 
/41 
be 
like, 
/23 
it 
puzzled 
/11 
/133 
much, 
so 
/18 
/103 
on: 
`But 
why 
/56 
/137 
live 
at 
/1 
bottom 
of 
a 
well?' 
`Take 
/110 
/479 
tea,' 
/1 
March 
Hare 
/184 
to 
/387 
/9 
earnestly. 
`I've 
/19 
nothing 
yet,' 
/6 
replied 
in 
an 
offended 
tone, 
`so 
I 
can't 
/92 
more.' 
`You 
mean 
/194 
can't 
/92 
LESS,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter: 
`it's 
/9 
easy 
to 
/92 
MORE 
/374 
nothing.' 
`Nobody 
asked 
YOUR 
opinion,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Who's 
/40 
personal 
remarks 
now?' 
/1 
Hatter 
asked 
triumphantly. 
/6 
/56 
/114 
/76 
/392 
/26 
to 
/62 
to 
this: 
so 
/18 
helped 
herself 
to 
/110 
tea 
/0 
bread-and-butter, 
/0 
/82 
/320 
to 
/1 
Dormouse, 
/0 
repeated 
/11 
question. 
`Why 
/56 
/137 
live 
at 
/1 
bottom 
of 
a 
well?' 
/107 
Dormouse 
again 
/148 
a 
minute 
or 
two 
to 
/57 
/115 
/24 
/0 
/82 
/415 
`It 
/7 
a 
treacle-well.' 
`There's 
no 
/160 
thing!' 
/6 
/7 
beginning 
/9 
angrily, 
/23 
/1 
Hatter 
/0 
/1 
March 
Hare 
/103 
`Sh! 
sh!' 
/0 
/1 
Dormouse 
sulkily 
remarked, 
`If 
/194 
can't 
be 
civil, 
you'd 
better 
finish 
/1 
story 
/34 
yourself.' 
/413 
please 
go 
on!' 
/6 
/184 
/9 
humbly; 
`I 
won't 
interrupt

I 
dare 
/62 
/141 
may 
be 
ONE.' 
`One, 
indeed!' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse 
indignantly. 
However, 
he 
consented 
to 
go 
on. 
/248 
so 
these 
three 
/249 
sisters--they 
/138 
learning 
to 
draw, 
/194 
know--' 
/455 
/56 
/137 
draw?' 
/184 
/387 
/76 
forgetting 
/11 
promise. 
`Treacle,' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse, 
without 
considering 
at 
/74 
/182 
time. 
`I 
want 
a 
clean 
cup,' 
interrupted 
/1 
Hatter: 
`let's 
/74 
move 
/151 
place 
on.' 
He 
moved 
on 
as 
he 
spoke, 
/0 
/1 
Dormouse 
followed 
him: 
/1 
March 
Hare 
moved 
/21 
/1 
Dormouse's 
place, 
/0 
/6 
/227 
unwillingly 
/148 
/1 
place 
of

March 
Hare. 
/107 
Hatter

advantage

/1 
change: 
/0 
/6 
/7 
a 
/200 
deal 
worse 
/167 
/374 
before, 
as 
/1 
March 
Hare 
/19 
/95 
upset 
/1 
milk-jug 
/21 
his 
plate. 
/6 
/56 
/114 
/265 
to 
offend 
/1 
Dormouse 
again, 
so 
/18 
/216 
/9 
cautiously: 
`But 
I 
don't 
understand. 
Where 
/56 
/137 
draw 
/1 
treacle 
from?' 
`You 
can 
draw 
water 
/59 
of 
a 
water-well,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter; 
`so 
I 
/258 
/57 
/194 
/245 
draw 
treacle 
/59 
of 
a 
treacle-well--eh, 
stupid?' 
`But 
/137 
/138 
IN 
/1 
well,' 
/6 
/184 
to 
/1 
Dormouse,

to

last 
remark. 
`Of 
course 
/137 
were', 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse; 
`--well 
in.' 
This 
/288 
so 
confused 
/386 
/387 
/69 
/18 
let 
/1 
Dormouse 
go 
on

/110 
/73 
without

`They

Dormouse 
/103 
/83 
yawning

rubbing 
its 
eyes,

it 
/7 
getting

sleepy;

/137 
drew

`Why

an 
M?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Why 
not?'

Croquet-Ground 
A

/141 
/138 
three 
gardeners 
at

a

curious

nearer

Five! 
Don't

`I 
couldn't

Five,

`That's

Always

`YOU'D

Five. 
`I

Seven. 
`Yes,

Five,

called

`The 
Queen!

First

three 
gardeners, 
oblong

flat,

at

corners: 
next

royal 
children;

of 
them,

/249 
dears 
/304 
jumping 
merrily

/296 
in 
hand, 
in 
couples:

/74 
ornamented 
/46 
hearts. 
Next 
/304

guests, 
mostly 
Kings

Queens, 
/0 
/221 
/236 
/6 
recognised

Rabbit: 
it

talking 
in

smiling 
at 
everything

by 
without

Then 
followed

Knave 
of

carrying

King's 
crown 
on 
a 
crimson 
velvet 
cushion;

So

`Idiot!'

politely;

`Why,

`It's

glaring

a

difficult

in

to

uneasy:

Queen,

knew

it

/126 
/360 
minute,

then,' 
thought 
she, 
`what 
/41 
become 
of 
me? 
They're 
dreadfully 
fond 
of 
beheading

here;

/238 
/69

/147 
/7 
looking

wondering 
whether 
/18 
/245 
/8 
/317 
without 
being 
seen, 
/43 
/18 
noticed 
a 
curious 
appearance 
in

air: 
it 
puzzled 
/11 
/9 
/58 
at 
first, 
/354 
/94 
watching 
it 
a 
minute 
or 
two, 
/18 
/37 
it 
/59 
to 
be 
a 
grin, 
/0 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself 
`It's 
/1 
Cheshire 
Cat: 
/457 
I 
/65 
/71 
somebody 
to 
talk 
to.' 
`How 
/267 
/194 
getting 
on?' 
/184 
/1 
Cat, 
as 
/256 
as 
/141 
/7 
mouth 
enough 
/34 
it 
to 
speak 
with. 
/6 
/463 
till 
/1 
/48 
appeared, 
/0 
/82 
nodded. 
`It's 
no 
/27 
speaking 
to 
it,' 
/18 
thought, 
`till 
its 
/321 
/71 
come, 
or 
at

/151 
of 
them.' 
In 
another 
minute 
/1 
whole

appeared,

/11 
flamingo,

/216 
an 
account

feeling

/228 
/18 
/19 
someone 
to

to

/107 
Cat 
/75 
to

/7 
enough 
of 
it

in

/0 
no

of 
it 
appeared. 
`I 
don't 
/57 
/137 
play 
at

fairly,' 
/6 
began, 
in 
/227 
a 
complaining 
tone, 
/25 
/137 
/74 
quarrel 
so 
dreadfully 
/151 
can't 
/61 
oneself 
speak--and 
/137 
don't 
/220 
to 
/71 
/360 
/401 
in 
particular; 
at 
least, 
if 
/141 
are, 
nobody 
attends 
to 
them--and 
you've 
no 
/210 
/104 
confusing 
it 
is 
/74 
/1 
/197 
being 
alive;

there's

/207 
to 
go 
through 
next 
walking 
/115 
at

/424 
end 
of

ground--and 
I

/71 
croqueted

Queen's 
hedgehog 
/95 
now,

it 
/49

/43 
it

`How 
do 
/194 
/108 
/1 
Queen?' 
/184 
/1 
Cat 
in 
a 
/328 
voice. 
`Not 
at 
all,' 
/184 
Alice: 
`she's 
so 
extremely--' 
Just 
/82 
/18 
noticed 
/69 
/1 
Queen 
/7 
/50 
/324 
/202 
listening: 
so 
/18 
/103 
/83 
`--likely 
to 
win, 
/69 
/323 
hardly 
/42 
while 
finishing

game.' 
/107 
Queen 
smiled 
/0 
passed 
on. 
`Who 
ARE 
/194 
talking 
/208 
/184 
/1 
King, 
/125 
up 
to

`It's 
a

/184 
Alice: 
`allow

it.' 
`I 
don't

at

/184 
/1 
King: 
`however, 
it 
may 
kiss 
my 
/296 
if 
it 
likes.' 
`I'd 
/227 
not,' 
/1 
Cat 
remarked. 
`Don't 
be 
impertinent,' 
/184 
/1 
King, 
/25 
don't 
/123 
at 
me 
/108 
/495 
He 
/207 
/324 
/6 
as 
he 
spoke. 
`A 
cat 
may 
/123 
at 
a 
king,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`I've 
/418 
/69 
in

book, 
/23 
I 
don't 
remember 
where.' 
`Well, 
it 
/186 
be 
removed,' 
/184 
/1 
King 
/9 
decidedly, 
/0 
he 
called 
/1 
Queen, 
/419 
/7 
passing 
at 
/1 
moment, 
`My 
/64 
I 
/265

/41 
/71 
/182

/107 
Queen 
/19 
/391 
/151 
/60 
of 
settling 
/74 
difficulties, 
/152 
or 
small. 
`Off 
/46 
his 
head!' 
/18 
/415 
without 
/166 
looking 
round. 
`I'll 
fetch 
/1 
executioner 
myself,' 
/184 
/1 
King 
eagerly, 
/0 
he 
hurried 
/454 
/6 
thought 
/18 
/271 
as 
/32 
go 
back, 
/0 
/96 
/104 
/1 
game 
/7 
/125 
/83 
as 
/18 
heard 
/1 
Queen's 
voice 
in 
/1 
distance, 
screaming 
/46 
passion. 
/147 
/19 
already 
heard 
/11 
sentence 
three 
of

players 
to 
be 
executed 
/34 
/14 
missed 
/224 
turns, 
/0 
/18 
/56 
/114 
/108 
/1 
/123 
of 
/197 
at 
all, 
as 
/1 
game 
/7 
in 
/160 
confusion 
/69 
/18 
/86 
knew 
whether 
it 
/7 
/11 
turn 
or 
not. 
So 
/18 
/103 
in 
search 
of 
/11 
hedgehog. 
/107 
hedgehog 
/7 
engaged 
in 
a 
fight 
/46 
another 
hedgehog, 
/290 
/75 
to 
/6 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
/34 
croqueting 
/151 
of 
/236 
/46 
/1 
other: 
/1 
/391 
difficulty 
/211 
/69 
/11 
flamingo 
/7 
gone 
/85 
to 
/1 
/424 
/337 
of 
/1 
garden, 
where 
/6 
/245 
/96 
it 
/339 
in 
a 
helpless 
/198 
of 
/60 
to 
fly 
up 
/21 
a 
tree. 
By 
/1 
/73 
/18 
/19 
caught 
/1 
flamingo 
/0 
brought 
it 
back, 
/1 
fight 
/7 
over, 
/0 
both 
/1 
hedgehogs 
/138 
/59 
of 
sight: 
`but 
it 
doesn't 
/289 
much,' 
thought 
/387 
`as 
/74 
/1 
arches 
/267 
gone 
/150 
/182 
/337 
of

ground.' 
So 
/18 
tucked 
it 
/317 
/100 
/11 
arm, 
/69 
it 
/271 
/114 
escape 
again,

/103 
/397 
/34 
a

When

/207 
/397 
to

Cheshire 
Cat, 
/18 
/7 
surprised 
to 
/400 
/76 
a

crowd 
collected 
/335 
/485 
/141 
/7 
a

on 
between

King,

/1 
Queen,

/138

talking 
at

three 
to

repeated

arguments 
to

though, 
as

spoke 
at

/116 
it 
/9 
hard

to

/59 
exactly

/137 
said.

King's

if

it 
in

no

she'd

everybody

(It

last 
remark

/123 
so

`It

it.' 
`She's

Queen

to

/11 
so 
savage

met 
in

kitchen. 
`When 
I'M

Duchess,' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself, 
(not 
in 
a

hopeful 
tone 
though), 
`I

voice

to

`You're 
thinking

However,

bore 
it 
as 
/32 
as 
/18 
could. 
`The 
game's 
/125 
on 
/227 
better 
now,' 
/18 
/415 
by 
/60 
of 
keeping 
up 
/1 
conversation 
a 
little. 
`'Tis 
so,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess: 
/25 
/1 
moral 
of 
/69 
is--"Oh, 
'tis 
love, 
'tis 
love, 
/69 
makes 
/1 
/105 
go 
round!"' 
`Somebody 
said,' 
/6 
whispered, 
`that 
/323 
done 
by 
everybody 
minding 
/224 
/29 
business!' 
`Ah, 
well! 
It 
means 
/58 
/1 
same 
thing,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess, 
digging 
/11 
sharp 
/249 
chin 
/21 
Alice's 
shoulder 
as 
/18 
added, 
/25 
/1 
moral 
of 
/411 
is--"Take 
care 
of 
/1 
sense, 
/0 
/1 
sounds 
/431 
/92 
care 
of 
themselves."' 
`How 
fond 
/18 
is 
of 
finding 
morals 
in 
things!' 
/6 
thought 
to 
herself. 
`I 
dare 
/62 
/243 
wondering 
why 
I 
don't 
/156 
my 
arm 
/335 
/436 
waist,' 
/1 
Duchess 
/184 
/94 
a 
pause: 
`the 
reason 
/238 
/69 
/270 
doubtful 
/115 
/1 
temper 
of 
/436 
flamingo. 
Shall 
I 
try 
/1 
experiment?' 
`HE 
/271 
bite,' 
/6 
cautiously 
replied, 
/114 
feeling 
at 
/74 
anxious 
to 
/71 
/1 
experiment 
tried. 
`Very 
true,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess: 
`flamingoes 
/0 
mustard 
both 
bite. 
/279 
/1 
moral 
of 
/69 
is--"Birds 
of 
a 
feather 
flock 
together."' 
`Only 
mustard 
isn't 
a 
bird,' 
/6 
remarked. 
`Right, 
as 
usual,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess: 
`what 
a 
clear 
/60 
/194 
/71 
of 
putting 
things!' 
`It's 
a 
mineral, 
I 
THINK,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Of 
course 
it 
is,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess, 
/419 
/75 
ready 
to 
agree 
to 
everything 
/69 
/6 
said; 
`there's 
a 
/99 
mustard-mine 
/187 
here. 
/279 
/1 
moral 
of 
/69 
is--"The 
/479 
/141 
is 
of 
mine, 
/1 
less 
/141 
is 
of 
yours."' 
`Oh, 
I 
know!' 
exclaimed 
/387 
/419 
/19 
/114 
attended 
to 
/182 
last 
remark, 
`it's 
a 
vegetable. 
It 
doesn't 
/123 
/108 
one, 
/23 
it 
is.' 
`I 
/76 
agree 
/46 
you,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess; 
/25 
/1 
moral 
of 
/69 
is--"Be 
/26 
/194 
/41 
/220 
to 
be"--or 
if 
you'd 
/108 
it 
/156 
/479 
simply--"Never 
imagine 
yourself 
/114 
to 
be 
otherwise 
/374 
/26

to 
others

/26 
/194 
/19 
/336 
/41 
/71 
appeared 
to 
/236 
to 
be 
otherwise."' 
`I 
/57 
I 
/258 
understand 
/69 
better,' 
/6 
/184 
/9 
politely, 
`if 
I 
/19 
it 
written 
down: 
/23 
I 
can't 
/76 
follow 
it 
as 
/194 
/62 
it.' 
`That's 
nothing 
to 
/26 
I 
/245 
/62 
if 
I 
chose,' 
/1 
Duchess 
replied, 
in 
a 
pleased 
tone. 
`Pray 
don't 
trouble 
yourself 
to 
/62 
it 
/360 
/325 
/374 
that,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Oh, 
don't 
talk 
/115 
trouble!' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess. 
`I 
/130 
/194 
a 
present 
of 
everything 
/180 
/184 
as 
yet.' 
`A 
cheap 
/198 
of 
present!' 
thought 
Alice. 
`I'm 
/228 
/137 
don't 
give 
birthday 
presents

/495 
/275 
/18 
/56 
/114 
venture 
to 
/62 
it 
/59 
loud. 
`Thinking 
again?' 
/1 
Duchess 
asked, 
/46 
another 
dig 
of 
/11 
sharp 
/249 
chin. 
`I've 
a 
/206 
to 
think,' 
/184 
/6 
sharply, 
/34 
/18 
/7 
beginning 
to 
/38 
a 
/249 
worried. 
`Just 
/115 
as 
/58 
right,' 
/184 
/1 
Duchess, 
`as 
pigs 
/71 
to 
fly;

/1 
m--' 
/275 
here, 
to 
Alice's 
/152 
surprise, 
/1 
Duchess's 
voice 
died 
away, 
/166 
in 
/1 
middle 
of 
/11 
favourite 
word 
`moral,' 
/0 
/1 
arm

linked

hers 
/216 
to 
tremble.

/81 
/313 
/0 
/141 
stood 
/1 
Queen 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
/46 
/11 
arms 
folded, 
frowning 
/108 
a 
thunderstorm. 
`A 
fine 
day, 
/436 
Majesty!' 
/1 
Duchess 
/216 
in 
a 
low, 
weak 
voice. 
/298 
I 
give 
/194 
fair 
warning,' 
shouted 
/1 
Queen, 
stamping 
on 
/1 
ground 
as 
/18 
spoke; 
`either 
/194 
or 
/436 
/385 
/186

Take

/107 
Duchess 
/148 
/11 
choice,

/7 
gone 
in 
a 
moment. 
`Let's 
go 
on 
/46 
/1 
game,' 
/1 
Queen 
/184 
to 
/456 
/0 
/6 
/7 
/133 
/58 
frightened 
to 
/62 
a 
word, 
/23 
slowly 
followed 
/11 
/397 
to 
/1 
croquet-ground. 
/107 
/424 
guests

taken 
advantage 
of

Queen's 
absence, 
/0 
/138 
resting 
in

shade: 
however, 
/1 
/102 
/137 
/142 
/202 
/137 
hurried 
/397 
to 
/1 
game, 
/1 
Queen 
merely 
remarking 
/69 
a 
moment's 
delay 
/41 
cost 
/236 
/224 
lives. 
All 
/1 
/73 
/137 
/138 
playing 
/1 
Queen 
/86 
left 
/167 
quarrelling 
/46

/424 
players, 
/0 
shouting 
`Off 
/46 
his 
head!' 
or 
`Off

Those 
whom

sentenced

taken

custody 
by

soldiers,

of

by

of

an 
hour

Then

Queen 
left 
/293 
/76 
/59 
of 
breath,

/184 
to 
/387 
`Have 
/194

/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
yet?' 
`No,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`I 
don't 
/166 
/392 
/26

Mock 
Turtle 
is.' 
`It's 
/1 
/490 
Mock 
Turtle 
Soup 
is 
/37 
from,' 
/184 
/1 
Queen. 
`I

/142 
one,

/184 
Alice. 
`Come

then,' 
/184 
/1 
Queen,

he

/299 
/194 
his

As 
/137 
/342 
/167 
together, 
/6 
heard 
/1 
King 
/62 
in 
a 
/328 
voice, 
to 
/1 
company 
generally, 
`You 
/267 
/74 
pardoned.' 
/493 
THAT'S 
a 
/200 
thing!' 
/18 
/184 
to 
herself, 
/34 
/18 
/19 
/291 
/76 
unhappy 
at 
/1 
number 
of 
executions 
/1 
Queen 
/19 
ordered. 
They 
/9 
/256 
/304 
/145 
a 
Gryphon, 
lying 
fast 
asleep 
in

sun. 
(IF

don't 
/392 
/26 
a 
Gryphon 
/238 
/123 
at

picture.) 
`Up, 
lazy 
thing!' 
/184 
/1 
Queen, 
/25 
/92 
/182 
young 
lady 
to 
/96 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
/0 
to 
/61 
his 
history. 
I 
/186 
go

/96 
/94 
/110 
executions 
I 
/71 
ordered'; 
/0 
/18 
/342 
/293 
leaving

alone

/1 
Gryphon. 
/6 
/56 
/114 
/76 
/108 
/1 
/123 
of 
/1 
creature, 
/23 
on 
/1 
whole 
/18 
thought 
it

be 
/76 
as 
safe 
to 
stay 
/46 
it 
as 
to 
go 
/94 
/69 
savage 
Queen: 
so 
/18 
waited. 
/107 
Gryphon 
/491 
up 
/0 
rubbed 
its 
eyes: 
/82 
it 
watched 
/1 
Queen 
till 
/18 
/7 
/59 
of 
sight: 
/82 
it 
chuckled. 
/455 
fun!' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon, 
/398 
to 
itself, 
/398 
to 
Alice. 
/455 
IS 
/1 
fun?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Why, 
SHE,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`It's 
/74 
/11 
fancy, 
that: 
/137 
/86 
executes 
nobody, 
/194 
/239 
Come 
on!' 
`Everybody 
says 
"come 
on!" 
here,' 
thought 
/387 
as 
/18 
/103 
slowly 
/94 
/485 
`I 
/86 
/7 
so 
ordered 
/115 
in 
/74 
my 
life, 
never!' 
They 
/19 
/114 
gone 
far 
/87 
/137 
/142 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
in 
/1 
distance, 
sitting 
sad 
/0 
lonely 
on 
a 
/249 
ledge 
of 
rock, 
and, 
as 
/137 
/304 
nearer, 
/6 
/245 
/61 
him 
sighing 
as 
if 
his 
heart 
/41 
break. 
/147 
pitied 
him 
deeply. 
/455 
is 
his 
sorrow?' 
/18 
asked 
/1 
Gryphon, 
/0 
/1 
Gryphon 
answered, 
/9 
nearly 
in 
/1 
same 
/214 
as 
before, 
`It's 
/74 
his 
fancy, 
that: 
he 
hasn't 
/207 
no 
sorrow, 
/194 
/239 
Come 
on!' 
So 
/137 
/103 
up 
to 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
/419 
/81 
at 
/236 
/46 
/99 
/48 
full 
of 
tears, 
/23 
/184 
nothing. 
`This 
/140 
young 
lady,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon, 
`she 
wants 
/34 
to 
/392 
/436 
history, 
/18 
do.' 
`I'll 
/299 
it 
her,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
in 
a 
/120 
hollow 
tone: 
`sit 
/113 
both 
of 
/443 
/0 
don't 
speak 
a 
word 
till 
/180 
finished.' 
So 
/137 
/491 
/113 
/0 
nobody 
spoke 
/34 
/110 
minutes. 
/6 
thought 
to 
herself, 
`I 
don't 
/96 
/104 
he 
can 
EVEN 
finish, 
if 
he 
doesn't 
begin.' 
/275 
/18 
/463 
patiently. 
`Once,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
at 
last, 
/46 
a 
/117 
sigh, 
`I 
/7 
a 
real 
Turtle.' 
These 
/214 
/138 
followed 
by 
a 
/9 
/314 
silence, 
broken 
/391 
by 
an 
occasional 
exclamation 
of 
`Hjckrrh!' 
/150 
/1 
Gryphon, 
/0 
/1 
constant 
heavy 
sobbing 
of 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
/6 
/7 
/9 
nearly 
getting 
up 
/0 
saying, 
`Thank 
/443 
sir, 
/34 
/436 
interesting 
story,' 
/23 
/18 
/245 
/114 
help 
thinking 
/141 
MUST 
be

to 
come, 
so 
/18 
/491 
/203 
/0 
/184 
nothing. 
`When 
we 
/138 
little,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
/103 
on 
at 
last, 
/479 
calmly, 
/199 
/203 
sobbing 
a 
/249 
/457 
/0 
then, 
`we

`Why 
/56 
/194 
call 
him 
Tortoise, 
if 
he 
wasn't 
one?' 
/6 
asked. 
`We 
called 
him 
Tortoise 
because 
he 
/427 
us,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
angrily: 
`really 
/194 
/267 
/9 
dull!' 
`You 
/70 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
yourself 
/34 
asking 
/160 
a

question,' 
added 
/1 
Gryphon; 
/0 
/82 
/137 
both 
/491 
silent 
/0 
/81 
at 
/386 
/387 
/419 
/291 
ready 
to

At 
last

Gryphon 
/184 
to

Mock 
Turtle, 
`Drive 
/83 
old 
fellow! 
Don't 
be 
/74 
/36 
/115 
it!' 
/0 
he 
/103 
on 
in 
these 
words: 
`Yes,

/194 
mayn't 
believe

`I

/184 
I 
didn't!' 
interrupted 
Alice. 
`You 
did,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
`Hold

tongue!' 
added

Gryphon,

/103 
on. 
`We

`you

`With

asked

a

anxiously. 
`Yes,'

`we

/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
`Certainly 
not!' 
/184 
/6 
indignantly. 
`Ah! 
/82 
yours 
wasn't 
a

/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
in

`Now

`You

`I 
couldn't 
afford 
to 
learn 
it.' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
/46 
a 
sigh. 
`I 
/391 
/148 
/1 
regular 
course.' 
/455 
/7 
that?' 
inquired 
Alice. 
`Reeling 
/0 
Writhing, 
of 
course, 
to 
begin 
with,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
replied; 
/25 
/82 
/1 
different 
branches 
of 
Arithmetic-- 
Ambition, 
Distraction, 
Uglification, 
/0 
Derision.' 
`I 
/86 
heard 
of 
"Uglification,"' 
/6 
ventured 
to 
say. 
/455 
is 
it?' 
/107 
Gryphon 
lifted 
up 
both 
its 
paws 
in 
surprise. 
`What! 
Never 
heard 
of 
uglifying!' 
it 
exclaimed. 
`You 
/392 
/26 
to 
beautify 
/238 
I 
suppose?' 
`Yes,' 
/184 
/6 
doubtfully: 
/388 
means--to--make--anything-- 
prettier.' 
`Well, 
then,' 
/1 
Gryphon 
/103 
/83 
`if 
/194 
don't 
/392 
/26 
to 
uglify 
/238 
/194 
ARE 
a 
simpleton.' 
/6 
/56 
/114 
/38 
encouraged 
to 
/235 
/360 
/479 
questions 
/115 
/24 
so 
/18 
/320 
to 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
/0 
/184 
/455 
/254 
/19 
/194 
to 
learn?' 
`Well, 
/141 
/7 
Mystery,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
replied, 
counting 
/167 
/1 
subjects 
on 
his 
flappers, 
`--Mystery, 
ancient

/184 
Alice. 
`Well, 
I 
can't 
show 
it 
/194 
myself,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
said: 
`I'm 
/133 
stiff. 
/279 
/1 
Gryphon 
/86 
/196 
it.' 
`Hadn't 
time,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon: 
`I 
/103 
to 
/1 
Classics 
master, 
though. 
He 
/7 
an

HE 
was.' 
`I 
/86 
/103 
to 
him,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
/184 
/46 
a 
sigh: 
`he 
/427 
Laughing

Grief, 
/137 
used 
to 
say.' 
`So 
he 
did, 
so 
he 
did,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon, 
sighing 
in 
his 
turn; 
/0 
both 
creatures 
hid 
/224 
faces 
in 
/224 
paws. 
/248 
/104 
/178

lessons?' 
/184 
/387 
in 
a 
hurry 
to 
change 
/1 
subject. 
`Ten 
hours 
/1 
/351 
day,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle: 
`nine 
/1 
next, 
/0 
so 
on.' 
/455 
a 
curious 
plan!' 
exclaimed 
Alice. 
`That's 
/1 
reason 
they're 
called 
lessons,' 
/1 
Gryphon 
remarked: 
`because 
/137 
lessen 
/150 
/36 
to 
day.' 
This 
/7 
/76 
a 
new 
/210 
to 
/387 
/0 
/18 
thought 
it 
/68 
a

next 
remark. 
`Then

/186 
/71 
/336 
a

`Of 
course 
it 
was,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
/248 
/104 
/56 
/194 
/246 
on 
/1 
twelfth?' 
/6 
/103 
on 
eagerly. 
`That's 
enough 
/115 
lessons,' 
/1 
Gryphon 
interrupted 
in 
a 
/9 
decided 
tone: 
`tell 
/11 
something 
/115

now.' 
CHAPTER 
X 
/107 
Lobster 
Quadrille 
/107 
Mock 
Turtle 
sighed 
deeply, 
/0 
drew 
/1 
/397 
of 
/151 
flapper 
/85 
his 
eyes. 
He 
/81 
at 
/387 
/0 
/129 
to 
speak, 
/23 
/34 
a 
minute 
or 
two 
sobs 
choked 
his 
voice. 
`Same 
as 
if 
he 
/19 
a 
bone 
in 
his 
throat,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon: 
/0 
it 
set 
to 
work 
shaking 
him 
/0 
punching 
him 
in 
/1 
back. 
At 
last 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
recovered 
his 
voice, 
and, 
/46 
tears 
running 
/98 
his 
cheeks, 
he 
/103 
on 
again:-- 
`You 
may 
/114 
/71 
lived 
/58 
/100 
/1 
sea--' 
(`I 
haven't,' 
/184 
Alice)--`and 
perhaps 
/194 
/138 
/86 
/166 
introduced 
to 
a 
lobster--' 
/209 
/216 
to

`I

/23 
checked 
herself 
hastily, 
/0 
/184 
/413 
never') 
`--so 
/194 
can 
/71

Lobster

/413 
indeed,' 
/184 
Alice. 
/455 
/198 
of 
a 
dance 
is 
it?' 
`Why,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon, 
`you 
/351 
form 
/21 
a 
line 
/376 
/1 
sea-shore--' 
`Two 
lines!' 
cried 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
`Seals, 
turtles, 
salmon, 
/0 
so 
on; 
then, 
/43 
you've 
cleared 
/74 
/1 
jelly-fish 
/59 
of 
/1 
way--' 
`THAT 
generally 
takes 
/110 
time,' 
interrupted 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`--you 
advance 
twice--' 
`Each 
/46 
a 
lobster 
as 
a 
partner!' 
cried 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`Of 
course,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
said: 
`advance 
twice, 
set 
to 
partners--' 
`--change 
lobsters, 
/0 
retire 
in 
same 
order,' 
continued 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`Then, 
/194 
/468 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
/103 
/83 
`you 
throw 
the--' 
`The 
lobsters!' 
shouted 
/1 
Gryphon, 
/46 
a 
bound 
/21 
/1 
air. 
`--as 
far 
/59 
to 
sea 
as 
/194 
can--' 
`Swim 
/94 
them!' 
screamed 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`Turn 
a 
somersault 
in 
/1 
sea!' 
cried 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
capering 
wildly 
about. 
`Back 
to 
land 
again, 
/0 
/205 
/74 
/1 
/351 
figure,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
suddenly 
dropping 
his 
voice; 
/0 
/1 
two 
creatures, 
/419 
/19 
/336 
jumping 
/115 
/108 
mad 
/197 
/74 
/182 
/230 
/491 
/98 
again 
/9 
/343 
/0 
quietly, 
/0 
/81 
at 
Alice. 
`It 
/186 
be 
a 
/9 
pretty 
dance,' 
/184 
/6 
timidly. 
`Would 
/194 
/108 
to 
/96 
a 
/249 
of 
it?' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle. 
`Very 
/58 
indeed,' 
/184 
Alice. 
/493 
let's 
try 
/1 
/351 
figure!' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
to 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`We 
can 
do 
without 
lobsters, 
/194 
/239 
Which 
/65 
sing?' 
`Oh, 
YOU 
sing,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`I've 
forgotten 
/1 
words.' 
So 
/137 
/216 
solemnly 
dancing 
/335 
/0 
/335 
/387 
/340 
/457

/82 
treading 
on

close,

waving 
/224 
forepaws 
to 
mark 
/1 
/230 
while 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
sang 
/72 
/9 
slowly 
/0 
sadly:-- 
`"Will 
/194 
/223 
a

/184 
a 
whiting 
to 
a 
snail. 
"There's 
a 
porpoise 
/50 
/324 
us,

he's 
treading 
on 
my

snail 
replied 
"Too

far!" 
/0 
/498 
a 
/123 
askance-- 
Said 
he 
thanked

whiting 
kindly, 
/23 
he 
/41 
/114 
join

/174 
not,

`"What

his 
scaly 
friend 
replied. 
"There

`Thank 
/443 
/323 
a

interesting

to 
watch,' 
/184 
/387 
feeling 
/9 
/228 
/69 
it 
/7 
/68 
at 
last: 
/25 
I 
do 
so

/69 
curious 
song

whiting!' 
`Oh, 
as 
to

whiting,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
`they--you've 
/88 
them, 
of

`Yes,' 
/184 
/387 
`I've 
often 
/88 
/236 
at

/18 
checked 
herself 
hastily. 
`I 
don't 
/392 
where 
Dinn 
may 
be,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle, 
`but 
if 
you've

/236 
so 
often, 
of

/392 
/26 
they're

`I 
believe 
so,'

replied 
thoughtfully. 
`They 
/71 
/224

`You're

`The

/1 
Gryphon, 
`that

/425 
go

That's 
all.' 
`Thank 
you,' 
/184 
/387 
`it's

interesting. 
I

knew 
so

a

before.' 
`I

/440 
if 
/194 
like,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon. 
/282 
/194 
/392 
why 
/323 
called 
a 
whiting?' 
`I 
/86 
thought 
/115 
it,' 
/184 
Alice. 
`Why?' 
`IT 
DOES 
/3 
BOOTS 
AND 
SHOES.' 
/1 
Gryphon 
replied 
/9 
solemnly. 
/6 
/7 
thoroughly 
puzzled. 
`Does 
/1 
boots 
/0 
shoes!' 
/18 
repeated 
in 
a 
wondering 
tone. 
`Why, 
/26 
/267 
YOUR 
shoes 
done 
with?' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`I 
mean, 
/26 
makes 
/236 
so 
shiny?' 
/6 
/81 
/98 
at 
them, 
/0 
considered 
a 
/249 
/87 
/18 
/498 
/11 
answer. 
`They're 
done 
/46 
blacking, 
I 
believe.' 
`Boots

Gryphon 
/103 
on 
in 
a

voice, 
`are

a

Now 
/194 
know.' 
/248 
/26 
/267 
/137 
/37 
of?' 
/6 
asked 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
/152 
curiosity. 
`Soles 
/0 
eels, 
of 
course,' 
/1 
Gryphon 
replied 
/227 
impatiently: 
`any 
shrimp 
/245 
/71 
told 
/194 
that.' 
`If 
I'd 
/336 
/1 
whiting,' 
/184 
/387 
whose 
thoughts 
/138 
/203 
running 
on

song, 
`I'd 
/71 
/184 
to

porpoise, 
"Keep 
back, 
please: 
we 
don't 
want

us!"' 
`They 
/138 
obliged 
to

him

said: 
`no

go 
anywhere

`Wouldn't 
it 
really?' 
/184 
/6 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
/152 
surprise. 
`Of 
course 
not,' 
/184 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle: 
`why, 
if 
a

/304 
to 
ME,

`Don't

"purpose"?' 
/184 
Alice. 
`I 
mean

I 
say,' 
/1 
Mock 
Turtle 
replied 
in 
an 
offended 
tone. 
/279 
/1 
Gryphon 
added 
/493 
let's 
/61 
/110 
of 
YOUR 
adventures.' 
`I 
/245 
/299 
/194 
my 
adventures--beginning

/182 
morning,' 
/184 
/6 
a

timidly: 
`but 
/323 
no

`Explain

Mock

gained 
courage 
as

Her

perfectly 
quiet 
till

/207 
to

a

breath,

/184 
`That's

curious.' 
`It's 
/74 
/115 
as 
curious 
as 
it 
can 
be,' 
/184 
/1 
Gryphon. 
`It

different!'

thoughtfully. 
`I

Tell

He

at

Gryphon 
as

However,

/107 
Hatter 
/81 
at

March 
Hare, 
/419 
/19 
followed 
him 
/21

court, 
arm-in-arm 
/46 
/1 
Dormouse. 
`Fourteenth 
of 
March, 
I 
/57 
it 
was,' 
he 
said. 
`Fifteenth,' 
/184 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
`Sixteenth,' 
added 
/1 
Dormouse. 
`Write 
/69 
down,' 
/1 
King 
/184 
to 
/1 
jury,

eagerly 
wrote

`Take 
/167 
/436 
hat,' 
/1 
King 
/184 
to 
/1 
Hatter. 
`It 
isn't 
mine,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
`Stolen!' 
/1 
King 
exclaimed, 
turning 
to 
/1 
jury, 
/419 
instantly 
/37 
a 
memorandum 
of 
/1 
fact. 
`I 
keep 
/236 
to 
sell,' 
/1 
Hatter 
added 
as 
an 
explanation; 
`I've 
none 
of 
my 
own. 
/270 
a 
hatter.' 
Here 
/1 
Queen 
/156 
on 
/11 
spectacles, 
/0 
/216 
staring 
at 
/1 
Hatter, 
/419 
/320 
pale

fidgeted. 
`Give

evidence,' 
/184 
/1 
King; 
/25 
don't 
be 
nervous, 
or 
/414 
/71 
/194 
executed 
on 
/1 
spot.' 
This 
/56 
/114 
/220 
to 
encourage 
/1 
witness 
at 
all: 
he 
kept 
shifting 
/150 
/151 
foot 
to 
/1 
/338 
looking 
uneasily 
at 
/1 
Queen,

in 
his 
confusion 
he 
/309 
a

piece

of 
his 
teacup 
instead 
of

bread-and-butter. 
Just 
at 
/182 
/102 
/6 
/291 
a

curious 
sensation, 
/290 
puzzled 
/11 
a 
/200 
deal 
until 
/18 
/37 
/59 
/26 
it 
was: 
/18 
/7 
beginning 
to 
grow 
/373 
again, 
/0 
/18 
thought 
at 
/351 
/18 
/41 
/8 
up 
/0 
/497

court; 
/23 
on

thoughts

decided 
to 
remain

as

as

room 
/34 
/51 
`I

/194 
wouldn't 
squeeze

/184 
/1 
Dormouse, 
/419 
/7 
sitting 
next 
to 
/51 
`I 
can 
hardly 
breathe.' 
`I 
can't 
help 
it,' 
/184 
/6 
/9 
meekly: 
`I'm 
growing.' 
`You've 
no 
/206 
to 
grow 
here,' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse. 
`Don't 
talk 
nonsense,' 
/184 
/6 
/479 
boldly: 
`you 
/392 
/243 
growing 
too.' 
`Yes, 
/23 
I 
grow 
at 
a 
reasonable 
pace,' 
/184 
/1 
Dormouse: 
`not 
in 
/69 
ridiculous 
fashion.' 
/279 
he 
/207 
up 
/9 
sulkily 
/0 
crossed

to

/337 
of

All 
/182 
/73 
/1 
Queen 
/19 
/86 
left 
/167 
staring 
at

Hatter, 
and, 
/95 
as

Dormouse 
crossed 
/1 
court, 
/18 
/184 
to 
/151 
of

officers 
of

court, 
`Bring 
me

list

singers

last

on 
/290 
/1 
wretched 
Hatter 
trembled 
so, 
/69 
he 
shook 
both 
his 
shoes 
/454 
`Give 
/436 
evidence,' 
/1 
King 
repeated 
angrily, 
`or 
/414 
/71 
/194 
executed, 
whether 
/243 
nervous 
or 
not.' 
`I'm 
a 
/386 
man, 
/436 
Majesty,' 
/1 
Hatter 
began, 
in 
a 
trembling 
voice, 
`--and 
I 
hadn't 
/294 
my 
tea--not 
above 
a 
week

`The

/184 
/1 
King. 
`It

Hatter 
replied. 
`Of

/184 
/1 
King 
sharply. 
/282 
/194 
/92 
me 
/34 
a 
dunce? 
Go 
on!' 
`I'm 
a

Hatter 
/103 
/83 
/25 
most 
/197 
twinkled 
/94 
that--only 
/1 
March 
Hare 
said--' 
`I 
didn't!' 
/1 
March 
Hare 
interrupted 
in 
a 
/152 
/412 
`You 
did!' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
`I 
deny 
it!' 
/184 
/1 
March 
Hare. 
`He 
denies 
it,' 
/184 
/1 
King: 
`leave 
/59 
/69 
part.' 
`Well, 
at 
/360 
rate, 
/1 
Dormouse 
said--' 
/1 
Hatter 
/103 
/83 
looking 
anxiously 
/335 
to 
/96 
if 
he 
/41 
deny 
it 
too: 
/23 
/1 
Dormouse 
denied 
nothing, 
being 
fast 
asleep. 
`After 
that,' 
continued 
/1 
Hatter, 
`I 
/435 
/110 
/479 
bread- 
and-butter--' 
`But 
/26 
/56

Dormouse 
say?' 
/151 
of

jury 
asked. 
`That 
I 
can't 
remember,' 
/184 
/1 
Hatter. 
`You 
MUST 
remember,' 
remarked 
/1 
King, 
`or 
/414 
/71 
/194 
executed.' 
/107 
miserable 
Hatter 
dropped 
his 
teacup 
/0 
bread-and-butter,

/103 
/98 
on 
/151 
knee. 
`I'm 
a

Majesty,' 
he 
began. 
`You're

King. 
Here

guinea-pigs 
cheered,

immediately 
suppressed 
by

officers 
of

(As 
/69 
is 
/227 
a 
hard 
word, 
I 
/431 
/95 
explain 
to

it

done. 
They

a

it.) 
`I'm 
/228 
/180 
/88 
/69 
done,' 
thought 
Alice. 
`I've 
so 
often 
/418 
in

at

"There

`If

`I

Hatter: 
`I'm

it 
is.' 
`Then 
/194 
may 
SIT 
down,' 
/1 
King 
replied.

cheered,

finished

thought 
Alice. 
`Now 
we 
/65 
/8 
on 
better.' 
`I'd 
/227 
finish 
my

/184 
/1 
Hatter,

an 
anxious 
/123 
at

Queen, 
/419

reading

list 
of 
singers. 
`You

/184 
/1 
King,

/1 
Hatter 
hurriedly 
left

on. 
`--and

King 
/81 
anxiously 
at

Rabbit,

/184 
in 
a

voice, 
`Your

`Well, 
if 
I 
must, 
I 
must,' 
/1 
King 
/415 
/46 
a 
melancholy 
/269 
and,

folding 
his

frowning 
at

a

`Collar

For

whole

in

an

`I'M

/184 
Alice. 
`You 
are,' 
/184 
/1 
King. 
`Nearly

added

Queen. 
`Well, 
I 
shan't 
go, 
at

/184 
Alice: 
`besides,

`It's

his

hastily. 
`Consider

he 
/184 
to

jury, 
in 
a 
low, 
trembling 
voice. 
`There's

evidence

Majesty,'

Queen. 
`I

Rabbit, 
`but 
it

`It

(The

puzzled.) 
`He

on

`Where
